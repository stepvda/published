Hold me like you want me
Tie me to your kitchen chair
Feed me like a captive
Squeeze me 'till I'm out of air
You say you need
The monster I've become
But you keep on looking through me
Like you're searching for a part that's gone
Baby get my medicine
'Cause I can't seem to reach the shelf
How can you say you know me
When I don't even know myself
You say you need
The monster I've become
But you keep on looking through me
Like someone's dead or someone's gone
Baby
Driving me so crazy
Look at what you've made me
See what you're creating
The monster I've been
Baby
Driving me so crazy
I've been changing lately
Hold me up I'm aching
The monster I've become
The monster I've become
The monster I've become
The monster I've become
I'm a rabbit in your headlights
Running from a certain end
You're messing with my instinct
Just to see how far I'll bend
You say you need
The monster I've become
Burn me with your fire
Or let me go and let me run
Baby
Driving me so crazy
Look at what you've made me
See what you're creating
The monster I've been
Baby
Driving me so crazy
Look at what you've made me
See what you're creating
The monster I've been
Baby
Driving me so crazy
I've been changing lately
Hold me up I'm aching
The monster I've become
The monster I've become
The monster I've become
The monster I've become
The monster I've become
The monster I've become
