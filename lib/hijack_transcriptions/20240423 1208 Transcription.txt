Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm curious how to see if this thing really has a mind of its own and if it's coming up with recognized text which is more coherent. telling its own story rather than transcribing. Yes, I need to be more patient. Okay.Mumbling I guess I already talked about me and Multitask. Let's see. Another task. Okay, so we're going to do a little bit of a demo. Why don't we just talk about this really having a mind of its own as an intelligence, artificial intelligence that doesn't just allow or have the ability to be intelligent but also kind of conscious. Well, can you have a mind of your own without being conscious? Well, not while also being intelligent, I guess. Animals can have a mind of their own, their personality, but they're not intelligent. It's a stupid fucking animal. I hate animals, and I'm not saving them. I'm just trying to oust my frustrations, there's reasons to be frustrated in life, but the voices you are talking to, and I'm doing it anyway, I'm just repeating what they say, telling that this thing has a mind of its own and that I have to become convinced of this so that I can believe in something weird, and then there's another possibility that I'm changing now that I'm just going to keep as a surprise for probably later. Who's to say what the future... future brings? Definitely not. Bye bye. suspicious about this not working. Let me pause and do this thing to finalize. Hopefully recognize something.
