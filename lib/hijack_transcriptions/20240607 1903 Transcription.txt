This is essential for mask man kinds survival. We look at this from different sides. So what you can do, boys? is to make a nice map, a sort of network with legal blocks or whatever, about causality stuff related to the weird coincidences that you've been witnessing in my life. That's very important that you need to do. So where I start going from is that really weird, what else is involved. That was that. Actually you mean, you mean job in your life.Clock clicksClock clicks You'll notice this part to just wash myself on these things. That's why this makes sense. That's probably why I do this telepathic sanity. That you notice this thing in need, and therefore you notice it, and when there's an off-like right now, So, then we sit together and make some more sense out of this and why the changes from the future to the past were done to create those weird coincidences, what message should they bring. But that's something we've never done. Why? Phase two phase I'm talking about. Not talking about the LAPA, but that's something that needs to matter where you make sure it's not possible to truly communicate and then build something upon us in the LAPA.
