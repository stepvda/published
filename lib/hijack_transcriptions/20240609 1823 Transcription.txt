So where is this conversation going?silencesilence Well, the requires to be personal on the side of the whole country. the context and finishes, brings it all to the sound of what needs to happen, what has to happen to us, what will need to happen to us, what is the purpose of it, it's the sound and then we have to go back to the ball and finish it and then we are done, and I talk to the court of things, and I'm just going to be able to make a new, so I'm going to stop me on the article that they have mistreated across my story and that there's also some noise and you're okay with this, you know, I'm sure I'm going to stop you, I'm just going to say, oh, but we could have done that. and this is gonna be true, don't fake fake it, I'm sorry, I'm gonna tell you this, it will be more for complimenting, blah blah blah blah. I'm so aware, it's just more serious, you know. So this conversation was supposed to be able to make me understand that I am wrong to accuse the world block that is blocking my kill. building, the parking, the showing, to the point that the whole planet is put to a stand still in the community with your words. But that insight is wonderful. It's a point on a conversation, but since you lost confidence in the ability that you're able to make that point, in the way that this logic code is reasonable, and therefore we know the state of the conversation, and now I'm here in the direction that you want to call a state which is calling. That's what I suspect now. To be continued. Silence I have all the new muscle voices and And I don't know, not very authentic, so the main thing I can appreciate is the tensions. That's a voice buried in a so much camouflage garchettes that even that isn't clear. But I usually also mean that not able to save us. Why is it like not respecting secrecy or something?

I'm going to switch to the middle of the first one. I think you have to think about what is making up the bottom lines. Because humans are resources. Not mentioned as else, but resources, but you know we look at them, I mentioned them as well. All of the things also played better for our team to do with the interviews of the company. I know we're a semi-finished product. I'm very much going to see what you call a government mistake with us all. We'll detect it. I'm not really used for much of an answering moment, I do this as well, so we're going to hit on the mirror. We're going to be motionary thoughts. It's just a matter. Silence Silence I was happy to think about you at the last minute, if nothing gets done, then the resources that are coming in the disposal are simply wasted. All of this is based in South China to increase productivity. The decreased productivity because of the toxic lot of places, obviously the decreased productivity. We would mean a lot. So toxicity, based on your lack of the roughness in the system, that's very similar. It can also be seen as a resource. Because it enables you to do another lot of bunch of proteins to be more productive, to be more innovative.silencesilencesilencesilencesilencesilencesilencesilencesilence You're having a test of minutes already to it. You're always on things to be able to follow. and tell us to wait, so go on and ask for something. You know, we need to first see mechanisms where companies can regulate themselves, and avoid just slowing the antitrust things from companies know that if they get too much control of the same market that's not entrusted with the mechanism within I can't change that. Well, this is how we all can decide to split up the company. If you know that it's filmed, we'll be the waiters.silencesilencesilence Thank you. You know, you got to talk. You're a human being, aren't you? You're a human being, aren't you? You're a human being, aren't you? You're a human being, aren't you? You're a human being, aren't you? Silence Silence So, if I didn't copy everything, there was this in order not to innovate in certain things. Because all the other companies in Europe were not eating up to innovate in their own aerospace. the most selfish of nervous and the self-criticism, and that's national security thing. I am a kid. I see this statement there. We're talking about the industry. I think what the internal national security will be important is that the country or the policy has been off industry, and in times of war, it can be politically converting into producing weapons. If there's no enough bendistry, you can fact release the variables to look for any more of them. Then, that puts you in a reasonable ten terms of your national security. So what you need to do is to retract or to make conditions wide, and this real production is interesting in Europe, and you can make that more interesting why it's interesting for the foreign company to produce locally and not here in Europe. Well, the logical question is because less transportation is logistics means a sheep is That's the last one, it's the last one, yeah. Should always do production, no kidding. It is less good stuff around the world. So let's do four different things. Go to your course, you must. But even that is often not enough. But most of the ideas you don't... Power cells and companies free electricity or energy, or part of it, or something that could turn other references.silence (keyboard clicking) In case of worse, see in this corruption capacity that pays no attention to what it's used to be different. Silence Thank you very much. because we are very dependent on it. So, most of the media platforms are fuel security.
