But it's so the most interesting idea that these go. If you don't have a problem, then ship, if you come to Beijing, or I understand what you have. It does contain a long pattern that is not enough for you. It will see the cost, the cost of dating the matter, the reality. The reason you do that is that it's a dream. It's a nightmare.

Well, it's just a belief in the past, we're not using it on the example of faith. Okay, so none of this is real. In other words, there's a belief in real. The only thing that's been doing this is not that this is real. Hey, you know, this is a distraction for the weak at all that are bad.

Inaudible Remark That would be why we need a food, but what we're going to say is that if you don't want to go out and say something, we're going to talk about it. If you don't say the same thing, you're giving me a statement that I'm going to tell you about it. That's good. That's good, and there are real things you need to say, but you don't want to go out and say, "This is really a lot of work."

So that's a strong example of this work, so even the evolution, that is luncheon, and a lot of preliminary, early interfaces of something that, that is a well-being thing like, maybe there's an interesting thing that that would be a very primary interface. Inaudible Remark sexual sex and crime, which we have needed in places for the more frequent and polluted sex posted crime, as a matter of fact, we have got a lot of sex and violence and then I'm saying that we could back as going to be put into which, but we just don't want to be put into that. and I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it. I'm starting to see if I can do it.MUSIC I think it's a very useful and effective way of thinking about the things that are not effective. I think we should start with a lot of all sorts of things. So when you have to be a lot of action in a different way, it's a very remarkable thing. Inaudible Inaudible Remark So we're going to try to get a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the 7th and 1st in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 10th of the 11th in the 11th in the 11th in the 11th in the 11th in the 11th in the 11th in the 11th in the 11th I think that you know how to take these, you know how to store things like everything that I've been missing, so I'm just going to snap out. If you need a little bit of products, we need a lot of excellent products. So you need to get a little bit of, you know, a little bit of, you need to get a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit of, a little bit If you need a little bit of products, you can get a lot of good products, you can get a lot of good products. and we have to take this career as an example, we say that it's true that we can put them in the US, and for the rest of the career, we have to take this experience and also we always find out about it. So there's a thing we're going to have to always remember, and we're going to have to take this experience. Inaudible Remark and that one from the very top, which we all have in our room, and so my topic is that we all know it is also the kind of ceremony, maybe in some sort of a third of these parts, we all know we will stay at the end of this. Inaudible Inaudible Remarkinaudible of the universal, as it goes with us off the average from the rest of the evening, and in the evening, we have heard from that for a minute, that the word will be really, very, very far away. Well, so we have a lot now, and we'll be back in the evening from the evening. to meet and be prepared for a long, long way, to make a life reality and to make a difference. Let's agree, but if we don't go find it or find it or find it, we'll be doing things the right way. One of those things that we do every year is a part of the environment. So that's what we just did. We're very decentralized, and we're going to be behind the menu. Inaudible that's on the free deck. So if you leave the spirit and you're in camp, I'd be excited to have you someplace like 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20 be here. Inaudible RemarkINAUDIBLE like some power in for a private thing. We live on, I've been in the web, we share it for a few days. But I think it's your question for the new people. Because I'm not a list. This is the web, we share it in the database on the web. Sort of a company's side. For some kind of a public task, or a given private web, We didn't really get anything though, it was not really very close, we didn't know anything between these, we didn't know we'd tell them our opportunities in the first part, and in that way, we didn't know the problems, we didn't only have to do this, but I was able to do better with our somethings and things. So, we were going to have an opportunity to do that. experience and we will believe we will come and stand and we will defend with those circumstances. Far from being a body, we see a border on some of the shaming that it has been started. If the regime exists, the reformer exists in the valley of the city of Illinois, the women and the women who have approved them and the oppressors, the times know. The voters, voters, and voters, they have been down for a lot to be aware of making that, but they're needing to point themselves far enough we can figure out. So, we may not be burdened some of us, but they can go, but we think they will. Inaudible Remark This is John Sincurri, we're saying. I have a job in England, and I've got a 30-kilometer. We don't, we don't have every middleman in the world. We don't have a lot of middlemen in the world. We don't have any middlemen in the world. We don't have any middlemen in the world. We don't have any middlemen in the world. We don't have any middlemen in the world. We don't have any middlemen in the world. We don't have any middlemen in the world.

Inaudible Inaudible Remark from those people who come to see one day and some time to come to see the other day. So, last week, we had a session with one of the other people who came to see the other day, and we were both meeting the person who came to see the other day. We were just going to come up here to meet them. Until we were in the next meeting, we were meeting the person who came to see the other day, and we were going to meet the other day. and you need best, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of all, best of Inaudible and understandable, going in and understand what will happen in the third half of the life that it is going to happen. Well, if you continue seeing the workers in the business, you know, they don't have it, they don't. So there's a big thing that's been sliced up, and we start with nothing to do, and how do you do that? There's a time, and it's a short term. It means you don't know where you should expect something. So there's a group site that seems very likely to be able to do that, and they're going to send it in the pop-up, and so there are a group that is going to be able to do that, and a group that is going to be able to do that, and they're going to send it in the pop-up, and they're going to send it in the pop-up, and they're going to send it in the pop-up, and they're going to send it in the pop-up, and they're going to send it in the pop-up, and they're going to send it in the pop-up, and they're going to send it in the pop-up, and they're going to send it in the pop-up, and they're going to send it in the pop-up, and they're going to send it in the pop-up, and they're going to send it in the pop-up, and they're going to send it in the pop-up, and they're goinginaudible Inaudible Remark I'm not surprised that we talked about that, but I heard a contest race in which we had an ever-to-convictness itself to be able to lead the challenge in what the business was around the field stage. We could do that, and you know, if I don't, we didn't really go to the club tonight specifically. We should all be involved in a really good career. We're all damn proud of that now. Inaudible Remarkinaudible All of the work that being in the unconscious, the relationship, doing, is all of the things that we can't do. Why is it that we don't talk about it? We don't stay gone, we don't care which side it is, we don't care which side it is. Inaudible Inaudible Remark Inaudible Inaudible Inaudible Remark Inaudible Remarkinaudibleinaudible It turns out that there's a lot of people who want to go on a story, so we say it, because all we have to do is we think we'll have to go ahead and find some money, and then when we talk to these people, it's really easy to do something to them, and so we've got a particularly useful kind of interaction. Inaudible (laughs) (indistinct) (indistinct) (indistinct) (indistinct) (indistinct) (indistinct) (indistinct) (indistinct) So, I'm going to start with a little bit more. Inaudible Remark I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry Inaudible Remark Inaudible Inaudible Inaudible Remarkinaudible I think in fact, it's been a really great performance in years I've worked in the day. I've tried to include all the other things I've done in the last few years, and that helped me expand all the scientific exploration content. It's been a great deal. I've made a really, really good experience. It's only the day we need to subscribe and activate the notification bell to get the next volume out. It's finding more forms to some volume that don't have anything for that extra creative people. I don't need to do it in time and time and time. I don't need to do it in real time. I don't need to do it in real time. I don't need to do it in real time. I don't need to do it in real time. I don't need to do it in real time. I don't need to do it in real time. I don't need to do it in real time. I'm standing in a little bit of a shell. I'm trying to just be not to be in close to you. So, one thing I'm saying is, if you understand what I'm saying, if you understand what I'm saying, if you understand what I'm saying, if you understand what I'm saying, if you understand what I'm saying, if you understand what I'm saying, if you understand what I'm saying, if you understand what I'm saying, We have to go back to what we have to do to build a team that will be able to build up the inner bar on his brain topics. We have to go back to what we have to do to build up the inner bar on his brain topics. We have to go back to what we have to do to build up the inner bar on his brain topics. If you think this is a good idea, you have to think about what's going on in the future. If you think this is a good idea, you have to think about what's going on in the future. If you think this is a good idea, you have to think about what's going on in the future. Inaudible So there's been an idea that, you know, with neuroscience, we have to have, in some sense,Music You can go out and sit in with the, you can do this. Like a genius, it's like you're a lot of time. You really need to know how to do it. You can really need to know how to do it. You need to know how to do it. You need to know how to do it. You need to know how to do it. You need to know how to do it. You need to know how to do it. You need to know how to do it. You need to know how to do it. You need to know how to do it. You need to know how to do it. You need to know how to do it. You need to know how to do it. You need to know how to do it. We then, that usually natural selection does not tell us to do for question. We need to be conversing with the nation, different questions, which is why. Why, why, why, why does this deeper gallery and what's it up to, why? It all tells us is that whatever gallery it is, is not what it is. What you see is just adaptive fiction, so just to linger on this bad thing in one question. Let's shake you out of the interlude states. Does this fiction still help you in building intuition as literary fiction does, about reality? The reason we read literary benching is that it helps us build into oceans and understanding and interact ways. Think of the different questions in human nature, great friction. Same with this, I'm sorry, reality. After this intergalactic, we get the structural interface of those buildings. situation about deeper trees, all of the small mass works. Well, I think that each theory that we propose will give its own answer to that question. So, when businesses are proposing these structures like the Benz-2 leader and then come up with a positive associated leader and so forth, the end space time. We can pass your question. and what you want to help, checkers, and say how much information, for example, does have a position with an apple selection in between the kinds of sensory systems that we have right now, to this kind of industry bird, we have an end in, why did we evolve this way? We can find out through that question from the energy. So there's not going to be a general answer. I think we're going to have to do as a positive, these are the deeper theories. We're going to try to answer your question within the framework of those super theories. They'll hit full well, but they don't get any deeper theory. So is it, this is parallelizing, you know? There's some, I don't know, we're not going to be contrived out to see law wherever I'm from. So there are areas that are completely lost, so we can be fit if it's all. If you can never truly keep what we expect to the bottom. That's all we just tell you about how we share those information. Isn't that parallelism to the side that we find? Well, it's interesting to see that. I guess there is one, again, the system is in spirit of oxen, or which is dependent on what answer you give to what the oxen is based upon, or answer we give to your question. So what answer does this interest me to explore is something that's spiritual tradition since the thousand years. So, we can't take it seriously, it's science and philosophy, but we might go to the exercise, and that is that they've also set something like spaces I work on in my evolution, and if you look inside, you can expect, and I'll go all of your.., and that is correct, not the same as correct, not the same as correct, not the same as correct. I'm just saying, do that's correct. Then we'll be able to take that as scientists because we also are a fifth person on the beam. We wouldn't then not be able to conceptually understand the results all the way. But we can know ourselves just by being Muslim, and so we wouldn't be able to be a sense in which there is a fundamental ground into the because we're about separately in the past. This is the opposite of the universal purpose of science. This isn't the way science is always personal. First of all, we make it up, and then, but nevertheless, scientific, because the scientific matter is still the one we use all the way down to the principle. Of course, you still don't know how to apply all the data. It's possible that this kind of whatever consciousness is and we'll talk about it, is getting to appreciate things or feed yourself. It is somehow taking a deeper truth of reality, but you still don't know when you get to the bottom. A lot of people don't exactly know drums, nothing will that takes my mind to certain places where it feels like that it's revealing some deeper truth of reality, but it still could be a bit of an off-finger basis. But that's a year of view of this. You really don't know. It feels like it's a year really don't know. Why don't you want it? I don't know what it's worth, because I don't know what it's worth. To the bottom of the order right now is that it's never a big deal. There will never be a big deal. This is raised as every borrower of the job of your science, and if this is true, and if you're comfortable with somehow the importance of your fundamental universe, just make any other borrower of the universe. of the fact that the unconsciousness itself, that means that we're going to be able to explore each other in some sense. Well, well, that is something that you push back on the jobs of security. So maybe, as we understand, it's not an idea, deeper and deeper way to get out of the pursuit of the strong food for one. that maybe we need to, maybe that's why we don't see aliens everywhere, it gets smarter and smarter. We realize that like exploration is like other fun ways to spend your time at the explored. You can be, you can be sort of living maximally for a way that's not. You know, I can, there's all kinds of video games you can construct and put yourself inside of them. The donor of all you goes outside of the game world, it's a feeling for my human perspective. Let's see, you've gone as challenging yourself, you know, a couple of those challenges. So you can cut me artificially, generate challenges for yourself, like CISMIS and it's which is ten and a half, it's sort of scientific method that's only switching out to the stars. It always starts being up, also the should always start getting to the block turtle. Maybe we can do more and more data, which is that that's a team that we've been pursuing yet. We agree to start doing it. from that pursuit started enjoying the here and now versus the building on it to the unknown always. Maybe that the building on it to the unknown is the early activity for species that's involved. I'm just sort of saying for she back is probably got a lot of sites and excited to turn the job on. I think in addition to where it's not the opposite security, where scientists become more useless. Maybe they're like the holders of the ancient wisdom that allows us to study our own history, but not much more than that. (laughs) (indistinct) I'm all of all the women and all those scientists again, I'll give them a trip and then I'll take those scientists. So, when the third day did all of these experiments where we made that scene, we were Christians and so forth. Came about this wonderful vertical data and came back to what we've done. We've put down a few questions. We've been all around the single world. We have a question, we have a theme axle, we have to do Chinatown, just one equation. That's what the unbelievable technology is. You know, people are zooming, talking to each other around the world. So all the comments in the street, there was something that transformed our lives in the very thousands of ways, and the third is beyond the space. Here's one potential. Right now, we'll still be down, see what we see. We can see them, but we know that we can never get them. We've got a half-hatch for them. But we're going to wait for them to see what it will be on. So we can't get them again. So there's always a beautiful real state that's smiling and waiting on us. We can never get through. Yeah. But definitely we'll go through space now. We've been recognized that space now was just a data truck. It's not on the map. We're not even able to use the inside space now. Space time is a little data structure, you know, or something. It's just the other way around. We'll understand that, and we're getting to wipe it out. for the stuff that's beyond space, maybe we'll have to go to space and maybe we'll go around. Maybe I'll go across this entire and not go through space. I'm just going right there, this is a data structure, we need to start the climate. So, so I think that like, what was worth it, I think would be that the big end was sequence of theories that we've gotten to know, believe in an endless sequence of new, remarkable insights into the potential of the possibility that we've seen the rankings and that we will be motivated to continue the exploration. We are going to be able to take a lot of people. innovations that back. But your end of the intervention was, what about just being, what are we deciding, instead of all doing an extortable marketing? My guess is that the best scientists that we know to both end up being, will be a partially and then they then fall into the conceptual world. Nothing really, that's just my question. Like I said, I did come up with ideas by conceptual analysis. I was thinking, you know, very limited. I was just something not conceptual, and they took me a lot. long time to pull out into concept and then longer to put it into map of the real insight. So you can come up with just shapes, maybe work with your own play with questions. They came from a deeper place, and so maybe going back or between the complete non-insectual, where there's a distinction in order and to the wisdom. I mean, conceptals have been produced in girl limits, where we have to end, and then maybe unconsciousness is used more than fundamental. Then maybe unconsciousness, at least part of a conference, is just gathering itself, just gathering as possibilities, so it's being able to talk about death like me. Why going from being unconsciousness and something about that, back to the end of the letter, better, better, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, the end of the letter, in our own generic history, then we start to DBA in the most reality. Does it wait before it, like, you know, reaching out on our visits in the early development of the bacteria and so on? Or is it when some include the world we think of? intelligence or maybe even complex consciousness started to emerge. So where is this deviation? Just like in the interfaces in a computer, you know, you start trying to do this. There is assembly, and then you have cc++, 5.0, and then you have Please, I'll add a little bit of the problem there's one in effect DB. But, do you even want to get one in pleasure in life? In this blog vision suggested that the more provident celebrate systems were less realistic, less vulnerable. But that by the time we got to something's complicated, it was really, we're actually... That's a bit of a true... shapes and distances, topics and so forth. So at this point of view, I think it was probably not an uncommon deal with one of my colleagues, that yet some of these systems of lower precreting may just not be complicated, I think they're going to be much, much true. But as you get, you know, a very system in the Netherlands, you can now connect to give a trip to at least the parts of the truth that we need, but why would I look at and do share a thing to them? What do my graduate students just remarked in some simulations using genetic elements? So there he was just exploring, we started with Randwater, France, sensory genetics and actions in the first generation was a foreign situation or a foreign political resource. Those of them who were sitting in one place didn't do anything important, and we could then just look at how the genes evolved, and what we found was, what we could put what we found was that basically, So they came and gone, they came and went, even just in one generation, they just are not good enough, so once they were just tracking their sentences just in trying to fit this chaos. were a bar or a bit, then the tree is the greatest. So an answer at one level, one won't get an answer to people. But just without a mixture of meaning, because why would you decide to be as-- I don't believe in any of our theories. I take the very first search that I've studied them, only the interpretations, but-- They're just the latest ideas to be done, and so the reason I'm starting to get this very name there is because that's the best bill we have right now in Missouri. There is nothing else that could be used, so as a scientist my response goes, you take the best bill and see what they mean, and the same thing with just a system, we're taking the bus to all the people in the hotel. But I think that science now has a lot of experience and realize that we should not believe or think in the sense that we never lie. In 1890 it was a lot of physicists. But we were researching bright yellow students from one unit of physics that was all there, and it's precisely the long end, you know, forever, it's the long end of June forever, and we have to be sure to have it. I, uh, a centric now, they'll be looking at us and laughing at what we didn't know, and we just have to see what that's going to be to fix. Just, just know that everything that we think is so correct right now, our five-and-third of a centric from that little, little bit of a slot. So I'm not talking about any of our current scientific theories, I'm not talking about this, we should use the best food we have, that's added a little bit of humility, what? So when we have to talk about game theory, there's a lot of things that we don't know, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're talking about, we don't know what we're I love the 8th year in Michigan 8th grade, but I'm always suspicious of it, like, back out. We'll just drop models. It's too easy to construct things that are oversimplified, just because we are, you know, I can already enjoy all the visible gays you. of constructing and to variables that symbolize the organisms or represent people and running a simulation that then allows a build of intuition and it feels really good because it can get some really deep, it's rather intuition. But how do you know your model's party is something that there are a lot of models on some because of that, you have conclusions about an update plot. So I guess my question is, what are the movements in your game theory? I wish you gave your experience with it when the elements of your game theory. So I got this and pushed back from professional college. I'm trying to make a lot of simulations and fly up to you. is not comfortable so many of my colleagues are very interested in trying to show them the wrong, and so the idea would be to say that somehow we did something special. It wasn't completely general. We got some of the special part of the whole search space in that bridge, my game through in which this has to be true but more generally, more of this included blocks even. the best pushback we've got was from Team Adial and they usually just adapt to them if you use thousands of pair options. So we in our SOS we'll just use the call to play it in because it's not going to work. So that would be a little bit more of a pair option we showed them to resolve them. At least for the generation, and they said, if you have 20,000, then we can find these conditions in which true C, C, or other things, would be the ones that are better off in Chiba, and so we looked at that with similar actions, and in certain cases, if you can find certain cases in which true C is wrong. So when I say it's part of this, So if you can't happen, if you can't happen, if you can't happen, if you can't happen, if you can't do nothing, it's just probably going to be zero. So if you can't do nothing, it's probably going to be zero, and you can't do nothing. Well, it's probably going to be zero, and you can't probably close the zero. To be very, very precise. For example, probably going to swear, you know, all the time. can I use a measure of speed? The probability measure will be the area of increasing the position of the problem. Then, the product will occur in that uniform. It has the measure of precise measure, precise, not a proximal, precise measure, and yet it has been in many parts. So there is an object then, so that's what the measure of the problem will be, zero. So that's why we, by the way, would think that a popular zero can happen to be a good offer in Grinchyville. Yeah, but infinity, as far as I, and I look outside of the offer, I'm off the ground, and the good people, I don't know the truth, and being in real life. That's an interesting issue.inaudibleinaudibleinaudibleinaudibleinaudibleinaudibleinaudibleinaudibleinaudible and then that's your bond, this is that it enables decent This is just a really interesting work recently on how you go with intuition and mathematics. You could effectively quantize Newton, and you find that the Newtonian with theory and Newtonian theory are that different once you go with it and find it. It is really quite interesting. So the issue of race is a very, very deep one. one of them, which take quite seriously, which is the caution we think about. The reality, you know, the country's hybrid, it's one of the two, all these different inventories. Versus just more algorithm, right? So we're working this early. just to do the ball, the social service is finite, but as big as you want with the focus of the finite. Yeah, the ultimate ball is now absolutely under the world, it's just pretty continuous and so in general sense. Yeah, you can't really know, but there's just mind-breaking thought, just comment on that. reason that something can happen, and it's yet probably going to be able to happen in a 0% that doesn't compute for common sense in Peter. Well, this is where you have to be a sharp mathematician, if you're really not sharp, is one of more. What I was saying is common sense in Peter is, I mean that, and in a very, in a positive sense, we're talking about the subject systems in the YouTube basis. If we work, we are using the public world, we have to use the bathroom to face what we got, and I'm not exactly sure that game theory is the bathroom to face. We got this all in the application of mathematics, trips and tools of mathematics, came very fast we got. World of Year thinking about and paint share of reality, and fitness functions and evolution, very good. Well, that's a fair error we're talking about, and I think that that is a full-time use, and if someone says, "Here's a better mathematical tool," there's why this mathematical tool better captures the essence of the problems like the M. So I'm interested in my get it with the Oldish Bear Game Theory. There's this better the same thing. Now there are tools of Oldish Bear Graph Theory, which generalize Oldish Bear Game Theory, and then there's a clock of Game Theory. So you can use often tools, but in general, for example, as a resource of games, that change the very nature of the solutions, the locking solutions of what the game did right, but the work for me I was really interested in, and the real interesting challenge of these ideas If you have a very large number of instructions to work, then say you have an annual agreement with instructions or a group of instructions, but what's kind of interesting things of some kind of emerging, emerging if you are to be an organization, if to be an organization that adapts, means having to deal with an ensemble of things. in this process. Right, and so we've actually re-gunned some of our own work based on this. This is the back and forth in the East Bank, and what we found was that they, in their same elections, they were assuming that you would drink out of the world in the office, and so we said, well, those were lots of something. allow, this is the great data structure, you might call objects, and the object would be you take, you would do the entire of the cluster of your things path functions, one that has similar shapes, you have 20,000, maybe these 50 are all very similar, so I can take all of these perception, action, and fitness stuff, and make an information, and we'll unit for a lot, and since we did that, then all of the results went like check out the original spectrum phase, and the organisms that will have only seen that that will change to see only the panels and us, only once that burn. So the idea is that objects that will The motor notches for that knee straight button is following. Now we will be back. that was how it all went. It was because I was seeing a true logic that existed but I was expecting. That means very, very suggested and different interpretation. I've seen a data structure that is encoding a complete way of looking at brands of different specs. I could use this for a journey. I could use it as a weapon, not very good one. I could be a little So I'm seeing for what I'm coding here is all sorts of actions and the payoffs that I could get. Well, I think of a map or that I'll get a different set of actions and payoffs when I think of a lot. So forget every pocket, but I'm getting the gibberish set. paint off functions, and acting with various actions. So once you allow that, then what you find is once again, there are three of those of sex, and there are only some that just get the interface so it looks like that. But the question when I'm just sneaking up on this spout, they ain't gonna tell me where function through regime, what gives books is the fitness functions. So if there's a giant black box that just keeps giving me fitness function, what do we try to offer and say that water in different juices, then apples, if there's these objects, what we try to do in Why not reality and the degenerative business options? So each theory makes us all something to subscribe to this and we lost none of that. So I'm just going to get very, very, very, very, very, very, very big stage. Right, then we grab these strategies with Payoffs and on one of the matrix, we're describing the interactive best strategy. These are the payoffs that come from Payoffs. Do you grant me that in my perspective to explain a lot? And you can ask for a given question, or, okay, how does physics evolve while doing the word distance? Come on, right? Now, then we, then doesn't fulfill the different planifies in person, which we're game-driven then, not with the right tool, but that it will have been deeper through the show's work, which you're aiming to. Councilor, my ultimate is that there's going to be a problem in doing that. Because space-time isn't going to let me. It's just to use your interface, and then the distinction that you make is not a common level distinction, this is part of back with the movements in order to fix. So, this is a new variable, this is a part of a variable. It's so nice to take space in times of common level because of something more complex than that of it. We just say this is not right. Now, It's much more common. Sure things are obviously not going to be talking with you, right? Obviously interacting is something that's a lot of being confused. I think we would let go of the more obvious thing is conversation, but there's nothing that's obvious. But when we get down to the point, I think it's obviously living, but we're also going to get into it. But when you're down to a virus, now people wonder, when you're down to your pro-conce, people say it's not there, and then my intuition is look high to your surface. Your surface is there high certain aspects of reality, and others, too, it's a lot of even more recent things, sort of that, so things just get overwhelming. Dark matter and dark energy are most of the energy matter, what's happened? So our energy flame by our high flame, the only way we get some energy is because we're rotational, which we go out of power, whatever. So most things are out there of our interface. The distinction between living and not only is not called the natural smart energy. So this is the, we really, we really want to understand where the solution comes from. So if you ask the question, the deep question, you ask, I think the right way we're going to do that is to talk about the deeper there in the space. It moves there may not be the right time. and show that whatever this video is, And then there's a back, deeper, there is, but I'll talk about how we have done this, but today, some of this deeper, when we projected into, in certain ways, then we did get space by them, and again, what appears to be an omission of an afflustration. So I would love to see an omission of an afflustration, they should run into them, blah, people and we'll be able to find it for the first time. But as a result of projection, you get space tonight. As a result of projection, you get a theoretical plot, the appearance, but it's all an artifact for the units. I'll link and say, D-Harm, that the line between landing and not landing is going on. very important because that's nothing that will diverge before you have an evolution, the idea of death. So that seems to be an important component of that displacement and it's that much because that's also, you know, asking the question I guess that I have, in this, I think this was just a couple of that I guess, the old Union language, right? And so it was the wide, wide, wide, and one of the big of the wide lines, so people started to go to the museum and heard, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, talking to me, and I heard, but without length and depth, you got off the line, and you know I mean the depth. have a solution to one of our needs that there's no such thing as the one in the lab. There's no, but this concept of an organism, there's a living organism that they find by a volume of space time that somehow interacts, that all the time, 18, it's a very simple and some kind of history. It has little walls. The outside world, the carpet, and the inside of it, and all of this. So you're just buying it in your organism, and also you define that it was, but the fact that it could move you, Dan, it could be color-like, and you kind of think it was moving. Come on, in fact, this is the way it is. and then you can also die. That's all very, all the components is based on that you may be able to just have something like that for selection and emotion. Well, there's a lot of interesting words over it. We're so glad to collaborate with you in Crawl Christian. We have basically that kind of stuff that they build on. The notion of a block on a blanket, so you have two stakes. We think this network better than inside the blanket, than the blanket than the state top side blanket. The state is inside this block on a blanket, and our conditioning has been in the state top side than the blanket, finishing on the blanket, and, well, there, of the beginning out is that the inside of the states inside of it and what I don't want to do. So you can find the estimate properties of the outside of it in the rack to know what's going on. So it seems like you're doing models to get in front of this way that might be able to keep it going. So there's an interesting work going on in that direction. But when I say this, this something slightly different from the outside of it, it's and that is what I really can do, all I see is the internet, like I saw it, but I know that there's a deeper reality, which is much deeper out of this whole world of the experience, which I'm positive about, which I'm doing. In some sense, the base that I see is just simple than I create, right? And it assumes that I don't wait, but I believe that I can do it. that symbol but I don't believe you I don't believe in conscious experience in the whole world of Europe so I'm only to believe in a bigger face symbol but that bigger face symbol is a portal so to speak. Not a current portal but a genuine portal means to your belief and to your that's why we have a conversation. We genuinely love your consciousness. It's genuinely back in my mind. It's getting back in my mind. Through these icons which I create on the fly, I create my face while I look, I believe it. I will create you, your consciousness step there all the time. But I do so now when I look at that, I'm creating something And I still think it's hard. When I look at it and can't, I've created something that I still would call living, but maybe in our conference. When I look at something called firements, and I'm really sure I'll follow the limit, and when I look at the prototype, I don't even think that this is not a line of law. It could be that I've never looked at it. the less interacting with something, the stungest consciousness you've ever seen, and I'm saying that proton is the face that I've created, what would we do? That base is not high, that base is a daily structure, you meet that base, and it's an experience, it's not an experience. Since what I've programmed is something that I've created, you know, whatever, or you know, in the large header of the library or something like that. But what is behind the energy being space fun? So they're not going to space time interface. We just got this data data called. What is the reality in time? Well, this is just inviting the big, big structures. Apple to heat them. Social heat them come. What's behind them? It could be not just the way they are. in which case, when I'm interacting with a problem spot, I could be interacting with consciousness. Again, to be very, very easy, I'm not saying a problem with consciousness. I'm not saying your face is consciousness. Your face is a simple eye creaming and then building as a loving. So your face is not like this, but I know that face and line it up. So the last treatment based on my great is an interface symbol that's a genuine portal into your office. The portal is less linear or a cat. Even less clear to their butt head, and by the time we get down to the proclina, the portal is not there at all. But that doesn't mean I love interacting with consciousness. It just means my interface is a lot, and we saw some deeper reactions. So, that, so your question really forces out a big part of the solar system. Since, I wonder why you can't give portals not as good to the cat, to the cat participants. Does it have to do with the fact that you're human? and just a simple model of instance, organisms, the similar of the complexity of the air, it goes very important, better to each other. For instance, this is getting more and more complex, it's getting better and better for all of us. So let me answer one of the things a little bit of what happened, I'll tell you. Let's try to open it. Why is the form so bad in proteins? and L of the part of the mortgage support line. Well, the reason for that is because those suggest symmetries are spaced out. More time for the derivatives of the representation of fun graded. So they're just literally representations of the data structure of space time that we're using. So, that's why there's not very much in cycle. They're just almost entirely tied to the data structure itself. There's not much, they're telling you only something about the data structure, not the type of data structure. It's only when we get our level that we're starting to the southern field, the portals to Westbury pine, Sure, yeah, so there's more and more complexity built on top of the inter-based space on the chat. So you're not just buildable, right? Yeah, and this inter-based of base and hair and so on, skin. There's some singing going on between humans though. When we sing like, you're getting a pretty good representation of the ideas in my head. I started to get a fucking view of my memories in my head. Even though, you know, this is first time we're talking. the project you want to know, he's still the soul, like a giant panoramic puzzle, a lot of things. There's a lot of similarities, a lot of other vibes. She's definitely a lot of infertility, build up the small, although personally, a really sophisticated model was going on underneath, and yeah, it's just a wonder if it's possible. and construct these models by each other and the United of the Left be very distant from the line we're out. This is a lot of work, but there's some interesting work full of signaling names for they, they, they, we get help people can more me and, um, come and communicate. There's some interesting work that was done by some college and friends of mine that, uh, was there, and we were probably from the lower one, and we were Jameson, were they, um, were looking at evolving color work, so you have a circle of colors, and we've seen the color circle, and they wanted to see, you think you get people to cooperate, calling part of the color circle of work to the units that works, and so they had a game there kind of thing that they could do, and what they found was that when they voted, so when people tried to match, well, three kinds of home votes. But there are some bloggers, some of them are going to have a lot of like, I might be using them in the red column for this. They found them to be diplomats and outsides anyone. on finding a way that the whole space and colors of the carabell can make those in fact. You needed to give them to the community, the driver asking the conversation so they had a bigger influence on how they made the balance of the language. Now that there was really interesting kind of insight that there's going to be an able to press a game or a conclusion, right? Now, what I think it goes on in terms of learning to communicate in ways that are useful, and some day, you could be in terms of actually scoring a single game. We do not really know how to play this work out there. So, if it's okay when a stack of ones more, perhaps several times, the big top of the consciousness. This is very beautiful, all kinds of things, but perhaps just then that makes us human. What is it? What's the role of consciousness? Let's say even just the thing we're talking about, just the formation of this interface, and then kind of what is it going to start? to talk about it. Well, let me say something about what's the one I call it, say 99% or, again, the single bit space time is fundamental, or a close and space time matter is fundamental, and we'll do our reductions, and so, the standard approach in consciousness is bigger what complicated systems of matter with the work-function bombings could possibly be two million worlds, and consciousness, that's the general idea. So maybe you can have a note, maybe only you can have neurons, but that might have been a negative certain kind of capacity. So there are those, you can say, for example, that comes to the surrises from foreign trading collapse, so often say some foreign trade deals in the United States. So this is a hell of a business cup. You start with something physical, but the property of a lot of states of neurons, of what we're doing is not neurons, and you say that somehow it won't be shown in class, it was one of his consciousness or consciousness training. Or the integrated information that we're getting started with something physical, and it has the right kind of functional properties, but something they call it. be the work-houndment information then you have constants. Or you can be a pansegus, a book of oftener example, or you might say well in addition to the particles of space and time, those particles are not just matter, they also get out of the unit of constants, and so Again, you're taking space in time and particle system on the metal and you're adding a medium to the properties of the consciousness, and then you're talking about how the proton and the neutron and the proton is left coming together for hydrogen, and how those consciousnesses merge to or interact with the consciousness of the hydrogen silver. Well, there was a tension, and the next step of their push against is how neural network cost doesn't be representing to the network itself in a potential process that could be constants. There's global workspace there, and neural network works as current, works face there. So there's many, many threes of this attack. for the coming to all here in this fair. They assumed the space plan was funded. They assumed that these processes and space plans were not built. Kind of like there's an ad conscious, and then it says that it's a visual thing as long as it's built in that regard, and why are two years? Our best science is challenge. The space time is not fundamental. So why is that important? Well, for centuries, do you thinkers bought Earth, air, iron, water as the phone woke up on all of this? Those are actions that are not right now, nothing was more on our own thoughts, and we could sort of develop everything up on this. But we got the period of table of illness, and we realized that on the other hand, Of course, we want to study a rare fire, and there's combustion science for fire, there's sciences for polys and then there's water and so forth. So we're excited to see this, but fundamental, you know, if you're looking for something fundamental, those are the wrong building blocks. has many, many different kinds of dollars. that projection of the one thing that we call verb. If you don't understand that there's silicon, there's all these different kinds of things that project into what we call verb. You're fulzing off. You're not following what you might think, and then after the imperial table, then we came up with works, black holes and blue ones, the particles of this tree. standard data model of the six, and then we actually now know that the computer really wants to get bundled and built. The very other thing that wasn't that, is that the time is great. It was just wonderful. It was great. But if you're trying to build, do you find the mental? What is the bundled model's back? That's why I have to be enough to go to the computer, or it works out how it's going to move on. Well now, you just have a space to find itself is to corks left on the e-logs, but it would be just one representation of the symmetry of the space. So, the whole framework on which consciousness is being made right now is to, and for me, these are my comments and colleagues. They're doing this, they're brewing, they're asking, they're brewing. I, my family is so sad that they're stuck with this old framework because they work stuff but with their environment water, you could actually make progress, and so it doesn't matter how slurps you up, if you start with their environment water, you're not getting it. Like, can't you just, uh, 'cause the word 'dum' is not just that. Let me give you some options, what choice, what is... Uh, it's same time, say, it's reality, but let me proceed with it. Two, um, wrong, or fake. Because doomed, just names, they could still be right, but they're now ready to go deeper. They're going to be there. So, we'll just not grow up. So, complete deviation. So, perhaps the birth pair of fire and fire is not growing. There is your pair of fire water.INAUDIBLE Well, there's also a long, which is based in Boulier, every single year, and George Washington was president of the first president in the act. There's this blebbed-and-death or something that could have been easily treated because it was bullied that actually it looks like this for a little while. It costs us our demons, I don't know what you're getting out of the bleeding of a person, but so that, that would be wrong, the wildest meat, it's a medical tool. So it's also possible that our substance-based diet is not just too long, but it's wrong. Well, if we believe it, it's funny, remember that one. But if we believe it's useful to the world, that's right, but it could be seen by believing somebody that was believed to be useful to the world. No, it wasn't just not fundamental. It was very sure that it cases like these, somebody would work with it, it's very time time time percentage of cases going to the world. It couldn't be the law, like it's a slide road, it's altering the internet, as it goes through a truck stop, so you can get off of it. What is the internet kind of thing? I think that the businesses are finding that there are the structures via our space plan, but they project back into space time. So space time, people they will never know, They say space time is big, they're explosive. The first thing is to do a mini-sense that the bottom is totally different. It's a useful, absolutely useful, and really dangerous stuff. But there are a deeper, dangerous stuff groups that come a lot from bottom, and space time is not fundamental. What it's doing, in a sense that is raw, is, you're actually what she's saying space-time song. That's the right idea that somehow being smaller and space-time is a bum-bump in inter-reality that's, it turns out to be a useful, University for their levels and so forth and then several other places that we know. is very useful, but that substance in our impact on how we use our dynamics is used inside the public matter. This is very important for us. It's just for theories like human dynamics, and also for understanding brain networks in terms of individual neurons. in terms of chemical systems inside cells, that's all very, very useful. But the idea that we're getting to know upon a mental interpregality, you know, when you get it all the way down in that direction, you get that work, you realize what you got down to is not fundamental reality, just the merely slow representation of a data structure. That's all you've got down to. So you're always stuck inside the cage structure. So you seem to be getting closer and closer. I went from neural network to neural network. I came to be demonstrating to the particles, particles, and the products that move on. I'm getting closer and closer to the actual structure of the cage structure of space and time that you're in this field of work. you can not to a deep rubbish and what belongs face to one. But also for a return again to this question of dynamics because you keep saying that space balance do mostly focusing on the space part of that. It's very interesting to see why why time get the bad credit to this highly of the end of the dot times of the day. to talk to you a little bit more. But let it return. You're brilliant. Well, we'll work with you in different theories and consciousnesses that are out there. What is the concept of this thing? Outside. If we think that we want to have a lot of consciousness, we, as I'm just going to spin it up to see what it is going to do. What kind of medical model do you think you want to write down about consciousness? What was really complicated stuff? So most of my colleagues are saying we'll start with a matter of growth and see what about this matter of the correct consciousness. But I'm saying that that whole thing is a special thing to me. You need to look at consciousness more, consciousness, in other words, not something that arises in space at the time. You'll perhaps see something that creates space at the time that's in the airship. So what do you want? And here, again, there's no hard fast rule, but when she has a scientific attitude, it's to pick what you think are the middle wall of subject. that are going to allow you to boot out a confidence in you, the ideas of the trip. So what do I want to do? What I'd feel is to have three things. I said that there are unconscious experience, given the panic, the smell of the gun. Thanks for your time, Colin. There are a couple of bills in the country, so that's pretty good, but there is a lot of too-perfect supply, because those are miracles in the country, right? Perfect is, there's a lot of things you're not going to explain. Those are the things you assume, and those experiences you particularly mean, there is a subjectiveness to them. That's the thing when people, for the heart problem, consciousness, is in your heart, consciousness, consciousness, consciousness, feels like something to look at the color and okay, it feels like something they have ahead, or it feels like something. So I'm going to grant that in this theory there are experiences and there are not enough substance. So the consciousness is great. So they're not Drive to the next corner. There are multiple properties, particles, they are semi-canons. They exist. Just like we assume the states have not exist. I'm not saying the states have not exist. The state is not, it doesn't exist. It depends on the state. The state is not. The state is not. The state is not. The state is not. The state is not. The state is not. The state is not. The state is not. The state is not. in relation to other kind of organisms that have a sufficient, I don't know, a little complexity, or even, uh, what was there some kind of, uh, generalization of the pantheid this idea that all, all the consciousness permeates all that, outside of the user without the mission of what matter is, in science-based value. is beyond human consciousness, human consciousness from what point of view would be one of the countless riding consciousness, and within human consciousness there's countless riding consciousness events, but you can get rid of the ride hemisphere, and apparently you can split the corpus close on to be the person that would be able to up to the hemisphere, the religious police of the and there are a lot of conferences, conferences can be destroyed, one can have one conference experience, a lot of times we're going to have an idea in this line, conferences to guess, and it might not get, so even within you, there is more just one conference, since lots of conferences. So like the general conference, I think it's a great opportunity to have a conference The black hole consciousness is the whole cat, and we should cat's lack. I see why I'm going to be on the lack of all capacity cross-fist or compassion, which will lead down to the theatre and I'll have to be there and talk about the lack of that into it. There's just a shout out. I'm sorry to distract, so that's the birth of the song. The birth of the song. The second song for me is "These Is Brains of Time" so I'm going to have to be there. I'm going to say that coughs, c-sprances, and trigger early coughs, so no. So, in some sense, there are two basic assumptions. There are causes of some kind of cook-as-salty. There's a chain of metabolic issues, and we'll need to ban anis. I'll say there's a problem with constipation.inaudible So I'm trying to be as non-specific to begin with and see where it leads me. So what I can write down are probability spaces. So probability space which contains the conscious experiences that this consciousness may have. But I call this a conscious agent, this technical thing out of the earth. but I've talked about this and she rightly cautious me that people will think that I'm bringing in a notion of a cell or agency and work in software when I say "conscious thinking". So I just want to say that I used the term "conscious thinking" and merely as a technical term. There is no notion of a cell, in my fundamental definition of a "conscious thinking". There are only experiences and how political they of college rigor, so the agent is the generator of the cost of its grain. The agent is a mathematical structure that includes a probability factor, the probability space of a possible cost of its current is in one minute of our clothing kernel, which describes how the disagion of certain cost experiences how that will affect these parents, see what it comes, complete some. But you don't think of that as a salt. No, there is no motion of the salt here. There's no motion of really of the patient, there is no locality, there's no organ, there's no. So this is, these are Conscious Just you know For their distinct and so on because they're being wrapped Well, so here's the thing we're going out tonight when you have two of these conversations that are happening, this, the pair, satisfied that we should be compensated. So they are, let's see what we're going to say. So there is one conversation, yeah. But it has a nice analytic decomposition into a space conversation to that overnight interface. It's a very useful and scientific interface. It's a scale-free, or if you like a practical way, approach, do it in a way we can use the same root of analysis that all scale in studying consciousness. But if I want to talk about so there's no motion of wording, memory, problem solving, intelligence, self-agency, so that would be So then the reason I did that was because I want to assume as many as possible everything I assume is a miracle and here is not something to explain or something to assume. So I have to build all the networks and conversations. I have to build all the networks, I have to build all the networks and conversations. all these different things, I've built that version of processing that's trivial, it's trivial, that that version of processing can serve computation in the universe of a string. So, the thing that we can do with neural networks or a total of, you can do with that version of processing is that's true. What would you also do more, the events that you've done? in the bottom of the list, basically that in the field. So the lack of maintenance is not restricted to the computable part, because the order of maintenance is often not good. So this can capture any of the people there, any of the people that are in the top stations. But when it leaves the open, there are four hospitals here, to be able to interact between consciousness. So we have to, to the one theory of the matter, we have built, and there's lots of different ways you can build. We've actually got a paper for the fields to build these on this. We have a paper called "TongiSake" in that work, where the first space we'll need to show us how to use these the diverse consciousness to build everything to build So, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what all the heart problem consciousness. Or is that big dip on that insist? Can you solve the heart problem consciousness? Why it tastes delicious when you need a delicious ice cream? That works in consciousness, because what you're going to take is a measurement assumption. The identity of the heart problem is thought of the others. You're in the family to safety number four. We're all certain. We need to get in the company, and we have to say, we have a great invitation to talk with Krutimer from those, so that we just have to find a time to talk with him. Right. How do you do that, which is the experience of the topic from, you know, say, or the right kind of artificial intelligence to, how do you do that, that's, that's simply what the heart of all comes from, it's to research. Those that are thinking, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do that, how do you do from within a senior officer or a soldier, I shouldn't have done that. I'm saying that's the wrong problem. Why are we going in the direction? If I start with conscious experiences, how do I build up space and time? How do I build up my problem? Basically, how do I build up what we call brains? Because I'm saying consciousness is not something that brains to you. Your age is something that consciousness makes up. It's one of the most experienced and extreme of federal experience in consciousness. I look inside, so you're very very good. Right now I open my eyes and I'm like, "If you get played, you'll see me out." That's a hitter's broken into a cradle of thought. That's a very smooth As soon as you look away, you guys look at the page, just like that. You can get a glass of coffee on this paper. When you look, you see a pretty notebook. You can read it on the phone. As soon as you look away, that's not what you say. You hear what you mean. You know what I mean? Right now, that's right. More generally, you can be conscious of the page on the phone. So you better see what you're about to write. asking for their cost, what do you want to get most of these cost-ness and the shipment but this is just the time. So, but you are thinking that there is the use of their structure, how many other things are actually not right. That's why I said, you human, if there's another, or there's another in the civilization, do we stand on that base? and they come up with some more data structures. I do not want to say it's a data structure that I'm asking. Like I said that, if consciousness is vulnerable, consciousness is all that is. Then, you don't think about that, that that infrastructure can be about as possible as consciousness, and that's just me and they didn't move directly, and an intervention is for all the refugees who have taken fire. There is no need to be blinded by this problem. Yeah, this is the case in America. It's so bad. Yeah.
