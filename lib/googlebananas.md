# Google Search hiding results without shame.

Today, it is Thursday December 31st 2020, the last day the year. I was looking for an excerpt of an Monthy Python episode in which the gangs jokingly mocked British snobs by letting them say "Fa Fa Fa Fa Fa" hinting that They have no clue what they are talking about,and but that doesn't matter as is is just a way to show they are "different", implicitely hinting "superior" as anyone else.

Trying Google Search, I entered a search for "monthy python flying circus fafafafa".
