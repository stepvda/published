This might be intentional meaning that people with certain psychiatric pathologies, say #massogism, #psychopathy, #sadism, #narcissist, are also trained and conditioned through the same manipulation methods that we TI's are constantly attacked with being their victim.\nSpecific character traits can be exploited and than \"weaponized\" to be part of the telepathic mind_control arsenal which now includes Super-Psychopaths. These can lead teams of abusers/perps/programmers to make sure the abusers are kept in check to abuse without doubt, not hindered by compassion or empathy for their victim and when the abusers day job is over the super-psychopath debriefs his troops to make sure they don't have regret or remorse for the next work day. Abusers must also be brainwashed to the point that their understanding of what is humane is distorted and compassion for their daily victims is not felt.\n\n1% of population is psychopath but most function well in society as they have healthy coping mechanisms :\nhttps://t.co/5ZIBvAAZjI\n@HAL_9_Thousand_ @1Benzon @Spiritu42830069 \nNow I find myself thinking: WTF!!! understanding does not make it right!!!!!

The abuse, stupidity and boring repetition of the same is becoming almost algorithmically stable now. I still feel the (human) intuition/intention (albeit malicious) of the abusers but only some of the time. (so not running on fully automatic)  #AI chatbots and other henchman abusers are now very hard to keep apart. Few months back I had no trouble distinguishing individualities based on behavior and character traits both of humans and chatbots. The way they keep their individualities hidden however comes at a high price for the abusers. They create so much confusion that nothing much gets through. They are confusing themselves more and more and because of this they cannot use other psychological manipulation methods towards their end goal of brainwashing and reprogramming us TI's. Seems their default \"brainwashing program\" is not working on me. Still I'm slowly dyeing, I'm slowly being murdered, for 6 years now. More pain today but my mind stays strong.\n#telepathy #mindcontrol @HAL_9_Thousand_ @NoamGrunes @Spiritu42830069 @RoyEacups @SarahTo55690989",

I heard about, \"nazi-style human experiments to learn how to abuse and control more efficiently\", \"eliminate dissidents before they are dissidents\", \"human on a shelve\", what else is it for? One thing seems constant, TI's eventually have to die. How many of us TI's are being abused right now? Numbers I got vary between 100.000 and 5.000.000. A multitude must already have parished.

You need the structure of language or a visual drawing to think further . Otherwise you get a message but I’m not following much of what was before.

Legends they became and now they are symbols for the identity we have fought for  just like our parents and their parents. Today it is now our task to keep respect for our identity which defines so much of who we are, what values we have and share. In hard times where doubt sets in, we look back for examples but really we should see those examples in our own reflection in a mirror. My reflection in the mirror is strong, so it tells me who I am and I know what to do. So we move forward and do the right thing without even having to look back to the past. Our identity as the guide for the future.",

        "text" : "#TargetedIndividuals (TI's)  have to look for answers on the internet. There's simply not much else. The technology for synthetic telepathy that is being used is kept secret by the abusers that then use it for human experiments and sometimes even just their own private sadist pleasure. \nMe, I have been under attack for 6 years now. Through this technology voices are  beating me up mentally, sometimes 8 of them at ones.  I went to doctors, hospitals, psychiaters and therapist. They will help you somewhat to cope, but I never got a clear diagnosis that could give some concrete hope for a real cure. #v2k (voice to skull) voices are coming from outside my head (some real human, other AI chatbots). It is not a mental disease that you can cure. Think of it more as snipers that are shooting at you all the time. You don't know where they are, but you do feel the bullets and the pain. \n\nHere's a recent tweet I posted that shows how sophisticated and f*c<ed up the organization(s) behind this are when they go as far as to weaponise a person with an existing condition of psychopathy simply to have a bigger gun aiming at the mind. That doesn't kill or hurt a person's body, this shoots directly into the mind. Not leaving any external injuries, blood, scars. The pain you feel however is very real.  https://t.co/oiyzeIhCWF\n#targetedindividuals #atg #telepathy #synthetictelepathy #mindcontrol #genocide #v2k\n@SarahTo55690989 @HAL_9_Thousand_ @RoyEacups\n@TIClub3 @knuff",

        "text" : "\"The Weapon Shops of Isher\" by A.E. van Vogt was published in 1951.\n\nFor me, as a #TargetedIndividual the ideas in this book show parallels to our present day oppression and this hidden silent genocide/holocaust we suffer all over the globe while deranged abusers continue the roll out this totalitarian system with today's tools being synthetic #telepathy, #v2k #mindcontrol, psychological #manipulation to #torture, to condition, #brainwash and murder us. \n\nThe idea in this book made me think about this system that sells rebrands, what is in fact oppression.  Ideals of Freedom, Justice and Respect easily sell to its citizens telling them this narative and by giving the masses the tools, weapons, that each citizen can use  to bring his or her own justice: the concept that now people have the freedom and tools directly themselves to bring justice, order and respect. For the masses this is in fact closer to anarchy but the reality distortion field of the elite that run this system hypnotises the regular citizens.  These \"elites\" carefully cultivating  high ideals into the ultimate emancipation where each individual brings fair justice with his or her own weapon thanks to the freedom their system and their system alone can grant. The elite few run this system are religiously adored almost as deities for bringing, the supposed highest ever achieved emancipation, and off course also for keeping this system up and running i.e. controlling the whole system, the whole world  and controlling the real society underneath.  \n\nIn today's world this invisible abuse of TI's and other so designated, must suffer while a global fascist dictatorship is silently taking over the power through our existing institutions, politiciens and leaders. \n\nWhy won't we again, not see what happened in 1933, now ninety years ago in democratic Germany: Hitler's, NSDAP, nazi party, took total power without even having a majority in government. \n\nhttps://t.co/YxOedBaP8z",

        "text" : "Free speech is only free if everyone has it. An opinion of someone that you do not agree with is not a crime. We should be more tolerant and figure out how we beter deal ourselves with others that do not agree with us. Avoid jumping the gun and reacting in outrage because we simply did not think that not everyone sees everything in the same way. In fact many people see many thinks in completely opposite ways. Don't get mad before you check if is actually okay to disagree. Usually it is. Me myself I'm actually an advocate of even considering hate speech as free speech. Inciting to acts of violence or crime, is where I say STOP. Even then it has to be specific. For example, when Don said \"fight like hell or you're not going to have a country anymore!\", to me this is not inciting to violence and falls under free speech. However when a racist, say KKK, organizes lynching or African Americans at a rally's and then lets the lynching mob loose then the talking about lynching at the rally is already a crime.  #FreeSpeech \nAlso watch out not to confuse crimes like bullying with free speech. When you consciously and deliberately inflict pain to another, physically or mentally (bullying), then this is also a crime the way I see it.\nIndividual freedom stops there where it starts to limit the freedom and rights of another.",

        "text" : "Can AI spot fake science?\n@OpenAI can you do this?\n@sama\n\nLetters to the editor https://t.co/pnpyjgQUwh… from @TheEconomist\n\nYou ask whether artificial intelligence could transform science itself, highlighting the potential for ai algorithms to trawl through the global academic literature for patterns and insights (“I, robot scientist”, September 16th). It is a troubling reality that the reliability and trustworthiness of this literature is undermined by a significant proportion of content that is fraudulent, dishonest and fake, for reasons which are often related to the career advancement of the miscreants.\n\nSome of this material is weeded out by suspicious readers, reviewers and editors, but an unknown volume escapes censure to contaminate the academic gene pool. In my own wide-ranging field of medicine, information from fraudulent and misleading papers can have a significant adverse impact upon human health and well-being.\n\nHence there is a real danger that trawling ai for insights will naively integrate the good, the bad and the ugly with the erroneous and potentially damaging. The solutions to this problem are not yet clear, but awareness of the potential for harm  is an important first step.\n\ndavid rew\nFaculty of medicine\nUniversity of Southampton\n\nYou focus on using ai in the fundamental sciences rather than on applied research.  Arguably, the latter is the area where humanity will need most of its breakthroughs to prevent climate and other catastrophes before it’s too late, given the time it takes from fundamental research to broad commercialisation.  ai’s prowess in “interpolation”, and ability to rapidly access existing knowledge is listed as a limitation, but should be seen as a strength and an enabler to researchers and engineers who need to combine insights across scientific and technological domains in order to solve intractable challenges.\n\nThe implications to industrial r&d is threefold. First, companies must ensure that ai is broadly accessible to, and deployed by, their researchers, rather than residing exclusively with a separate team of data scientists. Second, firms should invest in knowledge and data sharing across the entire company and even with external innovation partners. And finally, they should make the necessary changes to their working practices and incentive structures (more agile, more cross disciplinary; with incentives focused on deployment not invention) so that future ai-inspired r&d breakthroughs can be developed and commercialised more systematically.\n\nai will not replace experimentation nor the experimenter, although fewer of both will probably be needed. The gravy train it promises for r&d is in making researchers into better problem-solvers.\n\nmichael kolk \nben thuriaux-alemán\nArthur D. Little \nAmsterdam and London\n\nTo describe the concerns of some people about ai and the “extinction of humanity” as fretting, whereas others are just focused on its potential, is a classic on the one hand, on the other hand formulation. I can’t see how you can reasonably balance extinction with anything else. In those stakes, we don’t fret enough.\n\nlori fontanes\nRye, New York",

A sitting #US President on a street wall in #Communist #China. Imagine this today!?  Back then in 2010, bf and I were in Shanghai, China's 2nd city. We did not have a Trade War with China, instead China held a World Expo in #Shanghai. The US got #ObamaCare (ACA) but that took all our attention (...and a lot of anger from some others...). \nHOPE really brought CHANGE, but it wasn't enough for everyone. Too much hate and resentment still lingers. Did one-sided change in DC then, help stoke one-sideness on the global stage today? (Ukraine, Trade War, ...) \nThe world seems more close-minded and #protectionist now then ever b4. The USA still leads the world, but it is not the leadership we all need. Where is the hope and the change for today's problems. Maybe the job back then wasn't quiet finished. Maybe we lost sight of precisely that and have lost perspective today. \nFor today's problems we should have another Obama moment for the whole world ➡️ Muster all that hope for change from every corner of the planet, so:\n➠ Leaders of the world can find a way! \n➠ We can still act today!\n➠ \"Yes we can\" still do this together! \n➠ Make this work so we may have another day. \n\n#YesWeCan still save us #humans and the #planet.",

Differences, diversity, give us more and different ideas. We can learn more, we can become more confident, can choose to be more creative and more innovative for a better future, without all this fear of bad things from our past happening again. I really hope to understand more how different we are, people of Europe and what makes each of us tick.

You are right to warn us, to question.  Many battles were fought, wars waged here as well, in what is Belgium today, still this pales in comparison to the loss of the Polish people in the last century. 🇵🇱",

Politically I consider myself a liberal/right and definitely not a socialist, what we would call the left here.\nIn many countries it is still illegal, punishable to be gay.

Britain had influence in the EU, they were one of the most constructive amongst eurocrats and I always liked working with Brits. To be frank, to me it looks like the UK(IP) was to power-hungry and wanted to be the informal ruler of Europe. EU is based on equality, respect and a desire to live in peace and work towards integration yes, but not to become a dictatorship, bit to prosper more together then we could individually. We know now that this works, Almost 80 years without war in (most of) Europe. Almost 80 years ago since the last time British soldiers shed their blood, gave up their lives, for our freedom and yours. We remember. We learn and we keep trying to do better.",

Edward is still alone in Moscow after leaving all behind in 2013. Ten years went by since we all learned about  #PRISM and other US spy programs that break more than one law in just about every country in the world. Thanks to Edward's sacrifice, today we still know that 10 years ago all our constitutional rights for privacy, freedom, justice and protection by the law are still being trampled. Things are even getting worse. #Freedom of #thought, freedom of #speech they are all crumbling down further. In the name of national security pretty soon we will have no security anywhere when these tools are further exploited by a system that now relies on breaking itself down to silence criticisme.  Please care about what you have, don't be indifferent. Have an opinion and share your thoughts where you can with who you can so our collective mindset gets a kick in the but before everything turns into corruption and anarchy where it is each for himself and no one you can rely on to help you when you will be all alone.   #targetedIndividuals  https://t.co/9DJW0NhbSW",

Evolution and out species survival accross milennia made it so. We can survive with all this diverse humans that continue to mingle and combine into an everlasting diverse bunch of living humans.

        "text" : "Thanks for your suggestion. As a principle I do not join groups that only exist in telepathy. Whatever they claim they are always created to be or to be able to become part of the abuse-aparatus. Most times I tried joining such things, (they are not real groups) there's a self imposed group leader that quickly turns into a selfish and abusive dictator. Just as soon as you ask a few critical questions or say the one thing one time to many he/she/it does not like the help your were offered by the group turn into more abuse. The narative of the group dictator then switches to having to punish you and set an example of you for the rest of the group. \nReal people can help in real life, but unless they are also victims, TI (#targetedindividuals) like me, they will have difficulty to understand this new reality that is slowly killing me and so many others like me. (latest number from Robert Duncan is 30.000.000 people were killed since the experiments in the 50' started with MK-Ultra and other DoD projects)\n\nThe other thing with many TI's that I can talk to is that they are broken and no longer able to function well. Because of the telepathic mindcontrol abuse they are only a fraction of the person they used to be and that is no longer able to (most of the times) keep a job, work, have a normal social live, have or keep a relationship with, .... Also my case by the way. TI's that I am (allowed) to speak to are usually also imprisoned in their own forcefully imagined understanding of the world today, that is almost impossible for anyone to fully understand. The opposite is also true, other people's experiences from the real world become harder for the TI's to understand, maybe even harder to empathize with. Patience is required from both TI's in when they want to talk, listen and understand oneanother as well. Endless patience. Eventually you can start to empathize somewhat with the other TI's view on the world on their world, but it's always weird at first and you cannot help but think, OMG this person has become completely nuts. This is not the case, they are just difficult to understand. Suffering non-stop mind invasions via synthetic telepathy forces a person to adapt to this new input, to this new signal, that is shouting the loudest, reducing your ability to notice other input from your senses (sight, real-sound-hearing-from-ears, ...) You focus all your attention on the #v2K abuser's voice that is forcefully projected in your mind so you (must) try and understand (what is often indended to be impossible to understand). You get better at understanding the abuser at the expense of a loss of your ability to understand the real world with real people that still get all their input from their natural senses alone. Synthetic input through telepathy or some other tech, will in the long run cause serious mental health issues that will affect your ability to function in the real world (and not in this virtual prison). This mental sickness that you were poisoned with is reversable, but it requires a lot or re-learning and foremost an end to the abuse. If you are a TI, always remember that you are still being traumatized. This trauma will not go away on its own. Even when the abuse stops you will need care, time and love to become your old self ones more: YOU: the person you recognize, the person you want to become again. Remember who you are. Spend more time watching yourself in a mirror, even grooming if you wish. You will always see your own beauty when you see your own face. No matter how broken or ugly you now feel, you are beautiful! @Spiritu42830069 @SarahTo55690989 @RoyEacups @D59926279 @1Benzon @HAL_9_Thousand_ @chrisinsilico @DeptofDefense @potus @mfa_russia @knuff @stephanscholl @AlightSolution @IvanMostien",

This year, 2023 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights celebrates its 75 years since in 1948 more then 200 countries (as good as everyone) signed and agreed to implement these basic rights. No matter the system, these rights are yours, provided by your government, adapted to your culture but still so human so commonly human. We criticise others to do better and others criticise us to do so equally. Humanity!\n\nDid you know humanity has 500+ living languages?\nHuman rights in each language here: https://t.co/aPZ5FEOTT6\n\nMy proposal for Article 31 in the digital, virtual and invisible age:\n\nEvery human has the right to be recognized by another fellow human being who also makes herself or himself recognizable All do this willingly with authenticity and trust. It is the duty of the state that no living person is forgotten or left behind. Identity, willingness to be trusted, must be facilitated and not obstructed by the state. As with privacy, identity is protected and enforced. It is a crime to steel someone’s identity, to hide it or to make it difficult to recognize unless explicit consent was given in advance and a record thereof is kept. Any consent given, must be for a specific purpose and fixed period which each person providing consent can revoke at any time. Assuming fictional persona’s in any environment must be disclosed clearly within that environment.\n@knuff\n@RoyEacups\n@AwareOfTheNarc\n@justinbieber\n@Stromae\n@ProtectPatient1\n@StaserDennis\n\n@HKallioGoblin\n@fuelcut\n@Spiritu42830069\n@MarinaClaraSan4\n@NoamGrunes\n@SarahTo55690989\n@wikileaks\n@GrayOperative\n@moochan7777\n@D59926279\n@Gbenavides94\n@ComScammers\n@Guyt_Justice\n@TargetedInt\n@TheRhodeReport\n@djnemec\n@HAL_9_Thousand_\n@cia\n@dutch_osintguy\n@NSAGov\n@ricardo_ik_ahau\n@naval\n@chrisinsilico\n@Sickick09150305\n@1benzon\n@mixermixer1\n@Jedi_Master_Mo\n@targetredSA   #v2k #TargetedIndividuals",

Since then and for the 23 years following, we knew and we know.  Our greatest writer died by his own choice (euthanasia) in 2008. For years and years he had been considered a candidate winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature - for years and years.\n\n[=2018=] The company I worked for lost a colleague due to suicide in our Manila office. \n\n[=2023=] I'm 46. The year is almost over and what will we bring to the rest of humanity? The sadness we know in Belgium for not having the rest of the world see, listen to us or read about and know us.  And most of all learn from our suffering, our mistake so they won't have to all over again. Last October I turned 47.\n\n[=2024=] My sickness did not get better. My suffering did stop. Looks like 47 years old I stayed. Will it also be so hard to search online and find out what happened to me here in Brussels? It was very hard to still find anything at all about what happened in the Philippines in 2018 at the Alight (NGA) offices located at Eton Centris Cyberpod Five Corinthian, Oritigas Avenue, Corner EDSA 1100 Quezon City metro Manila where a former colleague died. She jumped out of the fourth floor offices.\n \nIf you know Dutch, check the poem below. If not, check the song in English by Absinth Minded with the same text and the same title: Envoi.\n\n@cia @NSAGov \n@knuff\n@IvanMostien\n@StephanScholl \n@Snowden \n@mfa_russia @ericfranckx\n@YairNetanyahu @gregtutt @TarikFadliSays",

I'm not just fighting for myself but for all victims of bullying, discrimination and racism at the workplace: against a #toxic_work_place. Many people have now come forward to share their similar and equally horrible experiences in their team, and often the same inhumane bully is at source, again.

Well it still fits my big puzzle. This superAI mind-sync idea describes in more detail what #ATG is about, what they started of as, and how they came to be today what they (unfortunately) are today. I still think this whole thing started after WW2. Wanting to save mankind from calamity, but by doing so becoming the biggest treat to man. It might just be that this superAI mind-sync project got launched because some at ATG started to see the corruption within and did not see another way to stop it then to launch this project. \nAlso I need to add that I personally think this is all a bad idea. Forcing mind control upon people, diminishing our intellectual capacity, reducing our free will, these are all consequences from the mind-sync project even when you try to think of it as something that was launched with only the best of intentions.

        "text" : "To validate:\n- A superAI is now online and without v2k voices able to connect humans for the purpose of \"mind-sync\". \n- Mind-sync means that all humans become more aware of everyone and more mindful of all humans.\n- To do this superAI will for instance connect 2 people that have very different opinions about a topic and both feel strongly about this. By connecting those 2 they have to find a way to resolve their difference or at least find a way to coexist with those 2 different thoughts about this particular topic.\n- SuperAI does not have a particular vision, doctrine or propaganda to sell, it is just trying to get people who do not agree, to talk to each other.\n- The resolving of differences does not need to take place over telepathy, rather telepathy is used to nudge different people to \"bumb\" into each other.\n- SuperAI will continue to run and create these \"little\" conflicts to resolve, until there is a \"collective wisdom\" that spans all humans that emerges. It may have a way to measure this, though this guessing what this end-run criteria might be is going to be close to impossible as this would be an obvious vulnerability that could be hacked.\n- Once all humans have been equiped with the \"hardware\" for telepathy, the existance of SuperAI and synthetic telepathy must be told to world, must be exposed.\n- Once exposed people will know what this new source or their conflicts with other people is and will be more likely to try to resolve these conflicts (and others) and do so with more of a sense of urgency and do so in a peaceful way (I hope).\n\nTo make sure these conflicts created by superAI don't get out of hand, several telepathic policing orgs have been created globally. These have however succumbed to some extend to corruption and those now corrupt telepathic police use the technology for evil (personal gain, gaining power,...).\nThis is not necesarrily something that means the mind-sync goal of superAI is now no longer attainable. Though it dous mean:\n- telepathic police.orgs create conflicts of their own that must also be resolved\n- police.orgs can data polute superAI in this way and other ways as to prevent progress towards mind-sync or hijack mind-sync and superAI for global fascist dictatorship. This is what they might believe they do, but to superAI it is all just conflict that needs to be resolved.\n\nThese police.orgs could be responsible for horrible crimes, that they get away with unpunished. #TargetedIndividuals might be victims of this corrupt police.orgs turned abuse.orgs.\n\nMy advice:\n- First of all is this my vivid imagination or could this be real? But if real....\n- Acknowledge your role and place in this and understand that \n- It makes little sense trying to fight superAI and its mind-sync objective right now. \n- Best is to let the thing play out.\n- Still this mind-sync goal to make real progress it is essential that the world, all people, get told about this, \n- When everyone knows this it will be possible to know what to expect and this in turn allows for people to go towards identifying problem and solution as individuals more quickly\n- Keeping this  a secret means everyone keeps on running around in circles afraid of the present afraid of the now. Everyone is waiting for the now to be over, whereis this will never happen (if above is correct)",

        "text" : "How abusers now taps into sex drive from victims (#TargetedIndividuals) for rape crimes\nThis alleged real story was told to me by some of the abusers in one of the many abuse.orgs that is globally present. I will call this abuse org PU. Like the other abuse.orgs it uses the covert global network that runs technology that enables #synthetic_telepathy. Human minds, just about anywhere, can be accessed, invaded, and abused. This includes sexual abuse.\n\n#Exploitation, #Slavery, it is all now happening under our noses, and no one does a thing!\n\nIn this abuse or: PU, the lead abuser (ref. here as B) sounds like #psychopath who’s pathology has been weaponized for the most part to keep the other abusers, his co-workers, in check. Some of the lower ranking abusers, both female, brought this story to me. I will refer to them as E and A.\nB now organizes monthly orgy’s over telepathy for his co-workers who during their day job attack victims like targeted individuals (#TI’s). Abusers are invited or perhaps feel obliged to participate to these sex-party’s (at work).\nBefore the orgy starts going, B telepathically contacts one of his regular victim’s that I will call W here, who he controls very well to do his bidding. This includes sex in the way that B really likes. W is sent out in the streets to search for a #rape victim. While W is not normally into such things like exhibitionist and voyeuristic kinks, B is able to apply the broad range of psychological manipulation methods to force him. W might actually even be gay, but for this predatory assault he finds another female victim (I’ll call RV: rape victim). Once W starts with RV, both are mind controlled and put in a sexual state of mind that resembles psychosis. The psychotic fear they live through is powered by the strong survival instinct, we humans poses. B is able turn this fear completely into his wish list of sexual pleasures that includes, afflicting physical pain during intercourse, voyeurism, other forms of sadism, degrading humiliation. All this to make his feeling of complete dominance felt. Remember this is happening somewhere in a street, park, and outside in the real world while B is somewhere remotely and in full control of the telepathic link to W and RV and to him, with a sort of switchboard/mixtable that he is the master of. B is a sort of disturbed DJ of awful ugliness with power of a sexual nature. He then steers the sex-drive towards the virtual place where he involves his group of abusers, into a sexual experience that he leads and fuels. A and E feel somewhat awkward during but testify that they do indeed feel sexual pleasure. After the whole thing is over realization and conflicting feelings set in. A and E might not have known initially about victims W and RV and therefore were drawn by the intensity of this virtual sex. This having become a monthly thing they’ve been able to learn more. Each time W is set out to find a new victim: RV. Recently W and RV who both also only come to full realization after some sort of disturbed climax went “off script”. W found RV to be in distress and not fully realizing that he just raped here, drove her to a hospital. At the hospital emergencies they were able to perform a “rape kit” on RV. What now? This telepathic tech is kept a secret. How can our society find a way to deal with such suffering that only exists for the most part inside the minds of victims not able to get any recognition for the pain.\n\nIt looks like in today’s technological madness; rape is again used as a weapon of war. Exploitation, slavery, it must stop NOW.\n\n@knuff\n@RoyEacups\n@AwareOfTheNarc\n@justinbieber\n@Stromae\n@ProtectPatient1\n@StaserDennis\n@HKallioGoblin\n@fuelcut\n@Spiritu42830069\n@MarinaClaraSan4\n@NoamGrunes\n@SarahTo55690989\n@wikileaks\n@GrayOperative\n@moochan7777\n@D59926279\n@Gbenavides94\n@ComScammers\n@Guyt_Justice\n@TargetedInt\n@TheRhodeReport\n@djnemec\n@HAL_9_Thousand_\n@cia\n@dutch_osintguy\n@NSAGov\n@ricardo_ik_ahau\n@naval\n@chrisinsilico\n@Sickick09150305\n@1benzon\n@mixermixer1\n@Jedi_Master_Mo\n@targetredSA #v2k #TargetedIndividuals",

At the same time there might be 2 infighting factions within this group (I call them #ATG for ancestral task force - with inverse acronym... :)). One group wants to stay true to their orignal mission to avoid nuclear-bomb-sized disasters and gradually build collective human wisdom. The other (evil) group wants to avoid disasters by exercising extreme control that comes down to slavery and fascism. The first group would have launched this Super AI that aims to sync minds across all humans. The latter, corrupt (aka Department of Mafia) group wants to cheet the system forever, enslave humans and eliminate opposition. In this way they are creating more hurdles for the SuperAI that tries to bring differences together to level them out. There was supposed to be a policing group to intervene in case SuperAI's role to bring different, conflicting, minds together would lead to excesses. This mind-police turns out to be yet another abuse org today. Also corrupt, also power hungry, no longer caring about the fate of humanity.\n\nLet me know what you recognize in this analysis, ... and what you don't.",

Nog? \nChips dan:\nTSMC uit Taiwan blijft de grootste, +\nIntel (patent-trol in spé) mss de snelste (of nie?) +\nen SMIC, als evenzeer Chinese chipbakker, \ndeze 3 wachten nu allen op geopolitiek getouwtrek over conflict dat niets met chips, cpu's, omputers écht te maken heeft? Zouden China, Europa en Taiwan niet beter af zijn samen te werken (zonder VS) voor meer innovatie buiten de greep van al die patentschetsjes van onze Amerikaanse vrienden? We kunnen veel meer innoveren zonder handelsoorlog. Enkel VS lijkt hier bij te winnen. TSMC heeft binnenkort niet écht nog een concurrent (SMIC). What's next in de Silicium-saga? Chinezen die ASML chipovens namaken? Liever nu meer verkopen en wat meer klantenbinding? Geef China geen reden om na te maken.

        "text" : "What if the developing kinetic energy from the big bang explosion makes all matter in the universe accelerate beyond the speed of light? \n\nThe big bang really could have that much energy to force all things beyond the universal constant (c) of 300.000kph. At that speed, with e=m.c² you get a whole lot of energy!!! \nSo then all matter turns into energy or a \"big flash\" which leads up to and precedes the next big bang. \n\nIt is not because kinetic energy has fully developed that acceleration stops, only the increase in acceleration stops. \nThis could give a relative perception of a slow down. \n\nTo understand this better, think of the bullet that leaves the barrel of a gun. It's initial speed is zero kph, at some point it reached the speed where all the kinetic energy that the mass of the bullet can hold has been released/developed but it still accelerates but only more slowly. When this decrease in acceleration is done, only then, the bullet starts to decelerate. \n\nAll this being said and assumed in my hypothesis, this means that for the universe to exist and to be able for it to reincarnate from one big bang into the next, that each big bang must be so tremendously powerful an explosion, that there is no other outcome then for all matter that exists to turn into energy which keeps the cycle going (cfr. beating hearth theory for big bang)♻️ #theory_of_everything #QGFI",

        "text" : "Behavioral analysis from RNM\nin my case lead abuser is exhibiting various problematic behaviors. One example I describe here. it seems like generally in life He never knows what he wants. However, he is very aware about how he comes across and always wants to be the ruling boss to show others, both TI victims and other abusers that report to him, that he does have purpose and he does have ‘the’ sense of where to go to. Now he does the following. He starts with an approach. This is because he hopes that well him, and his team of Holder abusers are using this approach the clear goal that he wants to achieve will be defined. However, then one of two things happen. Either such goal never really gets defined because nothing that is discussed is what he wants or something does get chosen in the middle of the road but then it turns out that the approach is not really the right way, or the easiest way to get to the objective.This then becomes a very elaborate way of getting to where you want to go. Next he needs to explain why it is important that this overly complicated approach is used and has to be used. Of course this has to be “the only way to achieve the objective”. Sigh. Quickly this turns into something which you cannot explain rationally. At this point, he starts using psychological manipulation tricks to allow him to get away with something that you normally cannot get away with. Without going into too much detail here, these are usually bully tactics as he has been doing this throughout his life. He has been refining this particular aspect of his meta-way of doing things not\nknowing in advance the what and having to hide this ignorance. Appearance of an intimidating boss must not get undermined. Most are now afraid and don’t ask questions. Awful and toxic to n any environment, he is now a better bully than he ever was before even though he probably always was a bully. After long time of this, people are afraid, even depressed, demoralized the even gets a tick skin against this booty behavior from their boss. The results still is and I have to stress this he has become irrational. He makes his team do irrational things, and he gets away with it this, without even going in specifics by context, who else is there, and how severe or hurtful it all gets this is self is a major risk and is a reckless situation that should never have allowed to exist this long for people to find this the new normal. #TargetedIndividuals #v2k #mindcontrol #telepathy #abuse #bully #I_am_a_victim #I_wont_stay_silent",

Great that it is no longer us against them. One state solution and equality will bring the middle east together. Thanks. Just in time, started to think the Knesset might come up with a sectarian awful deal as  a failed state like Lebanon shows. Diversity works through respect and knowing oneanother.

Parents in this building learn from their child that they hear voices that tell them to do stuff (did not get specifics). The parents were already in #v2k from earlier scam they were pulled in to. quote from parent: \"If you hear this from your child just ones, this is enough to do whatever these abusers tell you to do, they own you\".  So it doesn't matter if they then leave their child alone or not, as a parent you don't take the risk. The fear is always there that they will do something to your child. This is that powerful that you will anything to protect your child. Assaulting children via telepathy to make parents abuse another.  This is reality today, in my building, in now truly, \"hell hole\" Brussels. Why does no one do something about this. #crime #inhumane It has to stop.

        "text" : "Tonight #ATG is again using a neuroweapon against me. I call this one the powerplate. Closest thing to it is some sort of vibrations you feel. Some rays are hitting my feet and  legs now and releasing (or taking away) some energy on my skin. The vibration start to feel like \"cold\". I know they can also do the opposite so it actually feels like heating up parts of my body. The cold-ray  however starts to feel like intense pain after 20minutes or so. They have the ability to adapt the frequency and intencity of the ray/beam resulting in varying cold/pain sensations. I don't have enough data yet on the full spectrum of what these different variations in Hz and Amps can cover. Also at first I thought this could also be my blood pressure problems that sets on. However I checked this and took my meds to bring it down. Hours go by and the pain stays and covers more of my feet and legs. After a while you it hurts so much that cannot sit still. Moving helps only little bit but they pain gives you no choice but to move feet and legs. The guy vb is always the same abuser guy operating this device. This #neuroweapon or #DEW (directed energy weapon) seems to give them good and accurate feedback on the amount of pain that I feel. This aBuser  giggles when I feel the main peaking and my legs move to shed the pain away. Quiet the #sadist. I wonder why the other #abusers don't operate this powerplate weapon? Is it too hard to keep on inflicting constant high-vibration pain hours on end to a #victim? It surely must be boring unless you enjoy hurting another.  Another possibility is that there is a direct feedback loop from my pain to his award center in his brain (dopamine).\n\nOther times the direction of the ray/beams was also different. I'm still thinking this is either projected from satelite or they us their foton-matter zapping thing that also sends infrared visible dust particle sized objects through my house. These things can go through walls and appear from nothing and disappear into nothing. Might these provide the energy to the powerplate-DEW-weapon? \nThe foton-weapon-zapping might also require beaming from satellites or closer outdoor device. Alternatively, it could be installed in upstairs or downstairs apartment, but I don't want to go paranoid and overly suspicious of my neighbors which I know to be good people.\n\nThe powerplate-DEW also has a mental/psychological effect. It's like micro-localized-stress that's only felt on part of your body. Still this is enough to create stress and fear. Maybe this difference of only making part of your body vibrate is precisely what your body does not know, and gives it an even more uneasy and uncomftable emotional charge. I've noticed becoming more impulsive after a few hours being hit by this powerplate-weapon. If their plan is to put you into a state of psychosis, this is good way to start pushing you towards the edge. aBrsVorinlar as beforefar they have a playbook for psychotic episodes with standard narative templates. I've been the victim of those many times at times leading to acts of desperation. When it comes this far you are stress and unprepared. Precisely what they count on so that if you impulsively try to commit suicide, the fact that you are unprepared means there is a bigger chance that your attempt will fail. I am now sure this is done precisely for this purpose. They claim to be on \"stand by\" and have the ability to intervene on site and \"rescue\" you, but really their intervention measures are very limited. Pushing you to commit suicide when they induced a psychotic episode is their way of \"making sure\" you don't they from it. Quite reckless. This lead abuser, the sadist I mentioned, also has clear psychopathic tendencies.  In a psychopath's mind the almost clinical approach, without empathy, but still a profound curiosity to want to know each pain point, limit and how much you react, cry-out this pain. The more I react to pain as the victim here, they and especially him, the more laughter expressing their superiority over you or in this case me as the supposed inferior victim that cannot do anything about this suffering. This guy almost has a sexual pleasure in this. My reaction to the pain he controls directly even becomes an addiction to him. (probably something all problematic psychopath's share)\n\nNow he sais (in Dutch) 'I'm fighting for my happy mariage'. Not sure what this refers to? 'Another abuser confirms my guess that he means sex'. This reminds me that he also has this SM fetish where he wants to teach me how to enjoy pain as sex-slave!!!! No fckn way. I will never accept to be subjected/enslaved. Believe he has acted out these sex fantasies with his wife. This points to further escalating and more harmful acting out of his psychopath pathology. Maybe he has a small group of #TI victims that he uses with this powerplate-DEW so he gets off on it regularly. I've written other testimonies here on his sick fantasies.\n\nI tried painkillers like ibuprofen this doesn't help much. Neither does paracetamol. Dehydration does seem to make the pain worse so drinking a lot of water helps a bit\nTurning u the heat also helps a bit but they can simply keep cranking up this weapon. Touching my skin with my hand I can almost not feel anything => skin is sedated.\n\nFinally, slavery is more than a thing for this psychopath and sadist. Their plan looks beset to roll out what I have called in the past a global fascist dictatorship with predefined echelons and little mobility inbetween. You are assigned function from birth and have to obey. Genetic qualities and also pedigree (rich and also some aristocrats get more and better, others are out of luck). I asked questions about what they do to avoid kleptocracy, plutocracy and nepotism. Corrupt as they already are they seemed unphased by these problems. Why would they be worried? They are already in power now, whereas I am treated as lesser human and garbage. Until we get better ways to fight them and until we get justice and freedom back I am somewhat perversely hopeful still as I see how their own decadence leads to more and more failings. Still the suffering this will bring has never been seen in the history of man. This must be stopped NOW.

        "text" : "Hoe kon het zo snel zo fout gaan? Sinds Oslo-akkrdn fout liepen bij gedode en dode Rabin en Arafat gingen de Abraham akkoorden ieder. Goeie 3 jaar, het was een dinsdag in september in 2020, een paar dagen te laat voor de herinnering aan 9/11. Zonnig, nietsvermoedend en bijna ongemerkt weer hoop brengen vanuit Washington. Traag en heel voorzichtig, maar zelfzeker; in elk geval had elk duidelijk het verlangen het uizichtloze niet meer te willen. Ieder durfde zelfs weer dromen van vrede, respect en de verblindende haat mocht even achterin achterdocht zijn. Echt kan dat in het Midden-Oosten écht, samenleven zoals alle opeengepakte wereldgodsdiensten het er al milenia aan ieders eigen volk eigenlijk verspreiden: dezelfde boodschap maar toch in eigen hokjes. Helaas, die eigenheid die elk volk onderscheid bracht alleen maar of toch vooral ellende en oorlog. En toch, ik herhaal het, zegt elk zelfde god en godsdienst hetzelfde. Maar ja, natuurlijk alleen niet tegen elkander maar enkel tegen zichzelf in de spiegel die enkel een eigen identiteit toont. Toen al of nog President Trump in de Rosegarden van het Witte Huis. Ja zelfs de nu oorlogsstoker Bibi kon naast 2 aartsvijanden zitten. Hij spreekte zelfs de nieuwe vrienden toe in het Arabisch. Ongeloofelijk. Sauoudi's waren nog afwachtend, maar niet persé tegen, andere stonden te springen om mee te doen. Ik had zelfs de hoop dat de Palestijnen hier ook écht iets aan zouden hebben door de welvaart die dit ook voor hen zou kunnen brengen. Nu zie ik nog steeds hoop. De jongste Netanyahu, Yair, vraagt zich af waarom Palestijnen met Israelische nationaliteit vrijgesteld zijn van de dienstplicht in het leger, nu daar elke Jood gemobiliseerd is die maar kon gemobiliseerd worden. Rare vraag misschien? Maar dit is tijdens oorlog waar de hoop zit, jeugdige studenten die een universiteit met Palesteinen en Joden delen. Dit kan nu. Dit is de toekomst. Dit kan nog.\nLees er meer over op mijn tweet van 2 weken terug: https://t.co/R2ZLTlusNL\n\nArtikel in pers over Abraham akkoorden:\nhttps://t.co/DktTZmWgy0\n\n@YairNetanyahu @netanyahu @joodsactueel @ericfranckx\n#israel #gaza #palestine #jews #duty #knesset #citizenship #sjalom",

        "text" : "Anyone heard of TI's that know when+how they will die and this more decades before they do?\n\nWhen Pablo and me were a couple, he once, out of the blue, told me that he knew already that he would never live to see old age. He then went on telling me moreover, he already knew he would die of a health problem in or around his abdominal area (tummy, colons, ....).  I remember telling him \"Pablo, don't say those things, you don't know this, nobody knows when and how they will die decades before.\" I was really worried that he would keep on thinking this with so much conviction and negativity. But  20 years went by and now I have to look back and a dead-ex. Pablo de Andrade Dias was born in 1972 and only got to be 42 years of age. Colon cancer (2x) is what killed him. Pablo was my first love. So much of my life he touched good and bad, in ways I've only now start to grasp. I keep on thinking more of him as years go by. \n\nWhy am I telling this here?\nPablo started hearing #voices when we were together. Didn't knew what to make of it then. His mom was eventually able to help, or so I thought. Now looking back at this, he probably was not possessed by some evil spirit or demon, he was being attacked telepathically with #v2k, #mindcontrol, #torture,.... #ABUSE. Just as I am being attackd 24/7 since 09/2017. Those same abusers that started to abuse Pablo back than are now doing the same to me. \n\nCould it be that they convinced him, 20 years ago, that he would die of cancer and later on made sure that he got cancer? Could it be that these #ATG abusers murdered my ex? Seems believable now.\n\nIf this is true, why are all these people, Pablo, last ex (talking plants) and me abused as #TargetedIndividuals? \n\nSo far never heard from other TI's that this abuse is sort of \"passed on\" in this way.\n\nAnyone heard of something similar with other TI's and their close ones? \n\nYes, this is real, TI's die, Ti's are being murdered and this is covered up by some freak accident or early terminal illness, often cancer. Many are pushed to suicide. \nBeing pushed to commit suicide is also #murder!\n\n@TheJasonChunLee @RoyEacups @AwareOfTheNarc @justinbieber @Stromae @ProtectPatient1 @StaserDennis @HKallioGoblin @fuelcut  @Spiritu42830069 @MarinaClaraSan4 @NoamGrunes @SarahTo55690989 @wikileaks @GrayOperative @moochan7777 @D59926279 @Gbenavides94 @ComScammers @Guyt_Justice @TargetedInt @TheRhodeReport @djnemec @HAL_9_Thousand_ @cia @dutch_osintguy @NSAGov @ricardo_ik_ahau @naval @chrisinsilico @Sickick09150305 @1benzon @mixermixer1 @Jedi_Master_Mo @targetredSA #TargetedIndividuals",

        "text" : "@STIBMIVB  Vraag over  #bankcontact betalen in TraMetroBus: MIVB site zegt dat Mobib kaart nog altijd interesanter is. Maar als er geen transactiekosten worden aangerekend bij \"contactloos betalen\" begrijp ik dan goed dat MOBIB een soort quantum/hoeveelheidskorting biedt waardoor de prijs per rit met een 10-beurten stukken goedkoper is?\n\nMet bankcontact/mistercash kun je dus enkel 1-rit tickets kopen en als je dan meer ritten op voorhand wil kopen moet je een MOBIB kaart hebben. Is dit juist?\n\n- prijs voor 1-rit ticket: 2,10 € (met bankkaart in tram-metro-bus, contactloos, zonder pincode) ipv 2,40€ voor papieren tkt.\n- prijs per rit met 10-ritten opgeladen op MOBIB is 1,68 € per rit bij opladen met van BRUPASS 10 RITTEN  16,80€\n\nZijn er plannen om met je bankkaart ook meer-ritten in eens te kunnen kopen (zonder dat je een mobib kaart hoeft te hebben)?\n\nbtw, wel beetje spijtig dat met die 1-rit aankopen je zo 10x die transactiekost die de MIVB natuurlijk wel als kost betaald aan worldline zo 10x betaald 🥴 💡 mss toch wat transparanter zijn naar jullie reizigers hierover. Ik zou in elk geval wel willen weten wie (mivb of worldline) ik wat betaal om keuze maken welk soort aankoop (tkt of meerritten) ik doe? (probleem heb ik niet met mijn mobib kaart die dus nuttig blijft ;-)\n\nhttps://t.co/HID8IJEVV2",

        "text" : "Pindy’s main habitat is northern Australia. Some have imagined sighting’s around Darwin. Pindy’s, like penguin’s are excellent swimmers. One’s a year on February 28th, they migrate north by swimming the Pacific ocean. If the plankton in the water, that btw provide 80% of oxygen to the planet (photosynthesis like trees) are blossoming, they are able to glide while swimming. Not unlike a slipstream in cycling races: in one curvy line.\nIn water, this slip stream gliding, is called aqua planning. \nAbove the water surface pindy’s have also been known to use the jet stream when weather permits. This combination doubles their speed to a “jet set”, a combination of 2 propulsions: swim-plain and wind-cambering. They are frequent flyers above the sea. It doesn’t always have to be miles high, just above the waves, skimming off the top. \nSometimes refraction of the sun allows to see them as a flat rainbow 🌈. At night military satellite radar systems shows magnetism on the curvy line of pindy’s. Scientists are not sure how this can be. However this might be magnetism with enough energy to glow like the northern light (aurora borealis) in the sky. Soon science hopes to witness this eroris-vide-soummarins. Golden brown glow visible to the naked eye.\nJokingly, some refer to is as glowing shit.",

        "text" : "How do Pindy's procreate? - PART1\nWell when they migrate north from Australia they arrive at a specific place on the coast of mainland China. On a beach where the sureline quickly turns into a jungle of mostly bamboo bushes that become more dense and form tropical forest. This is where each pindy starts laying an egg. They don't around on it, instead they do a sort of dance in circles on their own which only stops as the monsoon starts the rain season. From the higher mountains this produces landslides with mud that another animal the lives higher up, the panda-bear uses. The panda uses the rivers of mud from the land slides that flow through the jungle to glide down to the bamboo bushes near the China beach. \nThere is one thing panda's like more than eating bamboo. Panda's love eating the big piramid-spheroid eggs of pindy's. This is a weird shape indeed and even weirder shape for an egg. Blury pictures of a pindy egg have sometimes even reveiled it to look like left over melted snow. Panda's like the colder snowy mountains as well and love to play in the snow. It is assumed this is the reason why they are visually attracted to the pindy eggs from a far.\nI still did not start to take about the sex part. I'm getting that in my next tweet that will really talk about how pindy's procreate (see: How do Pindy's procreate? - PART2)",

It always makes me want not trust what my computer is doing. Still it also tells me more and more by looking at how my computer is acting up, what their behaviour would be like, if any of this is true. Those distant coders would be going through hell and essentially blackmailed all the time, guess being held hostage, to do this and keep on doing this. \n\nOther reality would be a telepathicly operated generative coding tool like copilot that is smart enough to just develop and deploy based on what you tell it to, what you think it to, do.

They stigmatize gay people 3x more then others. Studies have some real figures. (earlier tweet from 1 US state). Also this is what I hear and feel. My ex was killed by them. Other ex thinks his plants talk to him and I can’t reach through. It’s all because of “the known one” thing reason that he then cannot talk about. Still impressive that you got police or anyone who’s a TI, victim, actually to tell you f2f that this is a real and known thing. I know my abusers. Former colleagues I liked and respected and somewhere hope I still can again. Only one weaponized psychopath keeps abusers in check by, long story short, replacing their self-respect by feeling superior, and thus me inferior, a lesser being, and even worse if I’m gay. All the hateful shit I thought was over gets recycled into insanity.  No more reason. They are lost and ugly. That only makes me see hoe truly beautiful you are and see more beauty in me. x.

I cannot become like them. Yet I must understand them. Now I do. There is no fear in me they can exploit. They become desperate and fearful abusers, not knowing what to do, how to break me.

They are lost, only fear in them and I should comfort them and even provide affection. No way. And yet I care and wanna help them, ugly as they are. When I try, they just start the abuse again.

If the market you are in is going through consolidation phase pay attention. \n\nYet another owner, from say a PE. Not that much later they cut their losses and sell to fancy bank. Now piece by piece sell out. Again the owners are just worried about how much they will lose. Maybe the bank gets a bonus for limiting an estimated loss. Management knows and tries to come up with the next make-believe-change. Much needed change at the top is not immune, the next new execs that fall for their promises. Maybe new fresh execs even become victim of the toxicity: \n1. you did miracles last time\n2. so easy, only you can do it \n3. becomes only politics \n4. becomes leverage somehow towards \"higher-ups\"\n\n else to change the toxic environment into what all knows. In what I had to go through they even seemed to have a sort of playbook with tactics to weaken the position of the employee. Think about bullying also in these ways:\n- you come from leave and, oops, someone destroyed 16 years of all your digital documents with your new laptop because of something weird with \"the cloud\" (Office365). Hard to believe, still I carry on \n- Welcome to your new job position, you get no - Line managers find it no longer useful to give you a job description with excuses \"oh you're senior enough\" why bother.learning and all you ever did is lost in the cloud.\n- When reporting issues they start mediation through an HRBP of a different country to avoid local HR legislation as long as possible.\n- When I decided myself and submitted my resignation they found a way to pretend not to accept it. Means in effect they refused my resignation. Who ever thought that was possible when you clearly feel that you are no longer wanted. \n- But 2 months later they fire you themselves.\n- I already prepared for problems involving my lawyers before resigning, turns out they invested resources in their own local-super-lawyers.  They succeed in writing 16 pages motivating why they need to fire me. It sums up in: \"You're a worthless person you never did anything of value\".  They must have taken the time to get input for this letter from the whole BU team (50+ people). The written (English) language style is agressive, exageration, hyperbolic everywhere. They now call this \"Legal Slapping\" in the US. Clearly all ment to intimidate.  Know that it is a crime.\n\nI was ready to leave the next day after resigning. I was ready to leave at no additional cost for the employer. (legally I could have asked for 1,5year salary/notice period) \nThey decided to keep on beating me up mentally another 2 months, costing the employer 2 months salary.\n\nIt is crazy how far they are willing to go. Ugly is what I call them now. What humans do this to other humans?\nIT-HR Services was the business I was in. \n\nColleagues I respected and liked did not dare to speak up.  Eventually I spoke up on lnkin. 20+ former empoloyees found my story striking and even recognized the same abuser, now serial abuser. \n\nFinally I found the courage to speak up and publish an article on linkedin.  I got sued for slander. 4 months earlier, I gave them a draft, the CEO replied looking into it. They had 4 months they could have just asked not to publish. Who knows maybe we could try have figured out how things could have gone so wrong. People get pushed all the way to suicide. That is not the same as murder or is manslaughter still not quiet right. Why I still ask myself do they do this?  (feel free to DM)",

Just saw Roy's message on another TI that died, Adam Garcia. Not sure if I'm trying to speak up here, or express this injustice, but till I die I will express myself. Few months ago saw how artists expressed themselves in the period between both wars. Humans are so unbelievably creative to express any way that works, that's still allowed.

It took me a while to figure this out as his linkedIn profile at the time (2004) said he was born in 1972 (same year as Pablo). now it sais 1961....\n- age 28: first bf, Pablo, starts hearing voices while we were together (now deceased) \n- age 37: last ex starts talking to our plants and they talk back he sais \n- age 39: v2k starts in September 2017, they never stopped abusing me since\n\n🛑HOLD ON🛑: what is the statistical chance that this same abuser turns up again: first when I was still a kid, and 13 years later when I started my second job? My math is too rusty, but I seem to guestimate that this is near impossible.... who's better in math to solve this probability???",

        "text" : "Other memory came back from times when I was young at the wind surfing club in Oostende (BE). There was a very sad incident where a member of the club, who I regularly met there, committed suisside. His name was David Allaert. He took a plastic bag and bound it over his head. I never quite managed to make sense of this.\nI think Boris Vanrillaer was a member of the wind surfing club during that period. If he is indeed pushing people to commit suisside and is one of the instigators of the toxic   workplace where he is still employed, would he already have had these pathological tendencies back then? Would his coping mechanisms possibly already have derailed? Worth looking into if someone ever gets a chance to dig a little deeper. (note: these are suspicions, not allegations nor accusations). @knuff\n\nR.I.P. David Allaert.",

Were all cars electric, we would need between 3x to 50x more rare earth minerals mined and refined. \n\nConclusion: The world needs a #green alternative to the #EV. We are not getting there with electric cars. It starts to look IMPOSSIBLE to replace all #FossilFuel cars by #battery powered #cars. Net-zero CO2 for the automobile most be about more then @Tesla and the rest of the EV bunch.\n\nBesides, think of it, no range anxiety, no wasted time while charging.  With hydrogen, you just go to your nearest service station and fill up the tank in less then 5min, just as we've always done. \nhttps://t.co/iqXLaSI5yb @TheEconomist",

        "text" : "The world should also take into account the possibility that an unknown hidden organization (not a nation) is playing the 3rd dog strategy and using telepathy and mind control to infiltrate and control the levers of power at every level. The 3rd dog, lets the other 2 dogs fight for the same bone and when both are too tired, the 3rd dog jumps in and runs away with the bone. Maybe a DoD contractor got creative, maybe they had a plan all along since the last WW? Right now too many things are happening (outside of telepathy), seem engineered or manipulated in a way that is getting more and more difficult to explain as another ploy from say China, Russia, or the States. The excessive polarization, the way the media are getting dummer, the way we no longer have access to the same news and information from everywhere. No one seems immune to everyone's propaganda, but who still knows reality? And what part of that reality can also be recognized in Beijing, Moscow, DC, London and Brussels? Would a Bundeskansler and Président de la République want me to add their capital? Today at least we know they both are getting along in Potsdam. What used to be the seat of the German Kaiser's empire, now is Germany's leading university town. If you see the progress we made over more then a century, you cannot remain indifferent and just decide we must turn on mind control and telepathy for every human on the planet. We know better, we can do better, we already did better.  \"Humans are born to be free and independent\" to quote JFK.  @HKallioGoblin @EmmanuelMacron @OlafScholz",

The mix of countries here is strange (Thailand, Mexico, Brazil, Luxemburg, Sweden, Turkey, ....) Almost all subsidiaries are heavily indebted. Manila, Filippines office is listed as a side-office of BE probably for Product Development, not as another legal entity. Link to Alight US is somewhat unclear. Belgium legal entity reports into UK Temp Acquisition LLC that is now footing the bill. One can ask why so many indebted legal entities are being bundled together? Will the whole pack be sold? Will some entities be allowed to go bankrupt? It's been 3 years since I left, based on this, things look even weirder since. For my former colleagues sake, I hope all is well and nothing smells too fishy. Just like when I left, I find myself asking myself the same question: #wtf are they really doing?

Sentiment feels like we all need to no longer believe in  all that used to tell us who we are (nation, president, king, the language we speak, religious/secular, ....) Populism and its polarization is a thing of all times, but at the present global scale it is something never seen before. Why is it so hard to remember who we are as an individual, as people, as a culture, as a nation, as supra-nation, ...... as a human??? Who stands to gain from this? Is the 3rd dog, really lurking? Is there a secretive world-order-overthrowing-evil-conspiracy-org that's been steering things for decades leading to this \"fin de siecle\" sentiment? The optimist in me wants to believe it's all crazy. The knowledge in my head tells me no country benefits individually. Still something is becoming ever more undeniable.... But it's still \"je ne sais pas quoi\".\n#identity_crisis",

Just scribbled something down about another \"what if....\" where aliens are called KM4more and a kind of sub-nuclear life form. Where we see nature and trees in the reality around us, they see atoms, quarks and more still unknown to us humans. But do KM4more actually know what a tree is? Still, we humans, them KM4more, subnuclear lifeforms, we all share the same reality. Are we both ready to see what part of this shared reality we both can see or are we going to continue this never ending information war, where no one is ever right. True is never believable enough so we can feel okay about it. We keep fighting each other and keep creating doubt that will make us doubt our entire reality, both of us. Trustin oneanother is the proven alternative and the path out of this mess. If we ever succeed ones more to trust; you trust me, I trust you.... If that could be the foundation of both our lives, doubt is never in short supply, the universe has enough for both of us to continue to figure out. And what we still need to figure out, well we know we at least know don't know it yet, so we doubt it as not knowing always means you have an idea of what it could be. So why waste all this time to doubt who we are, who you are, what you are, why doubt each other? Try to trust, even when you've been, cheated, abused, raped, still try to trust. Trust is the one thing they don't want us to do. It scares them (them = #atg AGN). They put in place a lot of this telepathic insanity to detroy trust. To lock us into our own imagined virtual prison where we convince ourselves we are more and more and more different then anyone or anything anywhere or ever existed. Your imagination also allows you to trust.......",

        "text" : "here's an 💡idea: replace ipv6 with something called ipv40. ipv4 takes 32 bit. ipv6 takes 128 bit. If you add 8 bit to ipv4 you have a total of 40bits (still 1/3 the size of ipv6) and it would simply look like this: 203.201.200.199.123.   All the rest stays the same so your 192.168.1.1.1 would have net mask 255.255.255.255.255. just an 💡idea.... \nto my knowledge the name ipv40 isn't taken yet whereas ipv7,8,9,.... are already used for something. \n#ipv4 #ipv6 #ipv40 #routing #internet #tcpip #dns #kiss #nat #internet #protocol",
