## Where to find more info on me and this
more on Targeted Individuals, v2k and synthetic telepathy on my twitter/ x.com here: <https://twitter.com/stepvda>
those in my daily fight as TI are alight. You can find them on my linked in here: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/stepvda/> It still saddens me that these are actually my former colleagues. I worked for 16 years at this company which turns out to be nothing but a front for abuse, torture and mind control over synthetic telpathy. Main abuser is __Boris Vanrillaer__. He must be stopped.

## Note on the speech recognition available in the text files.
I've used the new speech reconition module from Hijack called -"Transcribe"- (beta version) from Rogue Amoeba in low resource mode. Text files are available with result. What is recognitioned is only 5% accurate, the rest seems to be an AI personality chatbot designed for cyberbullying. 
Note that I stopped doing this speech recognition with transcribe module because of the poor and piculiar results. Moreover it took a lot of processing power to do. There are enough recognized text from the early recordings starting in March that have text files which when you read some you will understand the problem just explained. The text recognition software has most likely been hacked. Weird that this AI personality feels like it was based on **Boris Vanrillaer**. Who knows someone else who knows him might recognize this also.

## Note on sound quality
Recordings were done using 3 different microphones at once. In first months I combined all into one mp3. Later on I split them in 3 different mp3 recordings. This means 1 recording per microphone. These can be found on the "split_microphone" folder here on github: <https://github.com/stepvda/published/tree/e6342f1d2cead17ac53fcfae88137094394a770e/lib/hijack_transcriptions/split_microphones> and also on the other sources (gdrive, onedrive and just added icloud as well). The 3 concurrent mp3 split mike recordings are available since June 14th.
