# Targetted Individual experience log 12062022

## Visual input slows down or interrupts voices

### experience
When I was on the tram I noticed when there when the landscape was moving at higher speed then the voices are starting to be interrupted and when it images I see are fase enough the voices become silent until there is again a still enough image so they can resume talking.

### speculation
Could be that when they try to look through my eyes that the available communication channel becomes fully used with too much moving images. Similar to the way video is processed on a computer where video encoding algorthmes require more bandwidth when there's lots of movement. One image following a previous image usually only stores what is different.

## Voices claiming to people I'm meeting

### experience
I was traveling on business and met new people there. Somewhat before but exspecially after the voices claim that they are the people I just met and that they somehow need to continue conversation in my head. This is somewhat supported with visual flashes especially at night. This comes across for the most part as faking.  This faking is not new, I had this for years so this experience is just another example I'm trying to share

### speculation
This faking could be used to extort people. Trying to find leverage on other people in my head. Possibly putting together pieces of a puzzle that even I cannot oversee since those pieces might come from different targets. That being said I'm so far inclined to think that I did not meet anyone who also has this telepathic communication (as a target or othe).
