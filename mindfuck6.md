# Exemple to voices of manipulation.
I'm trying to show the voices how they are manipulating conversations by giving them an example.

me: I'm looking at a star.
me: Is that a glow-worm.
voice: No that's a fire worm
me You mean a glow-fly?
voice: No a fire lime.
voice: No it's a gremlin.
me: Did you ever see a gremlin glow?
me: Did you ever see light coming from a gremlin?
me: Yes or no?
voice: Yes, I've a gremlin that gives light.
me: So you mean that you believe gremlins give ligh?
voice: No gremlines don't exist.

Now I've shown them how they manipulate and I how their reasining is wrong. 
They ask a question based on an obviously wrong suposition. At the end I had the feeling they understood their mistake in rational reasoning and rational thinking.
