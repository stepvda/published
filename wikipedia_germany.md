# 2 fake Wikipedia pages describing Germany
tweet: <https://twitter.com/stepvda/status/1604211953953546243>

## In short
Fake and misleading pages on Germany/Deutchland on Wikipedia. Seems deliberately confusing for @Google search to give you lesser quality through similar German words "Land" and "Länder" with different meaning. Lousy pages seem DE↔️EN machine translated.

## Links
These are the lousy possibly fake pages that seem machine translated:
- Wikipedia DE on "Land (Deutchland)": <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_(Deutschland)> 
- Wikipedia EN on "Country Germany)": <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_(Deutschland)>  
      ***Notice*** the missing leading bracket compared which is not missing in the German version.


These look like the correct pages:  
 - Wikipedia DE on "Deutchland": <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutschland> 
 - Wikipedia EN on "Germany": <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany> 

## How Google Search gets confused
In my search quest I was looking for the list of member states of the Federal country Germany. I know that a state of Germany, in German is called: "Länder". You pronounce the "a" with the 2 dots (called and "Umblaut" accent) as an E sounding in phonetic Enlgish the same as the "lender" the English word for someone who gives out a loan. A detail, nouns in German always start with a capital letter.
The Germand word for country is "Land". 

Google search, as many other text searches, does not distinquish letters with accents and without them. You now see how to Google the first 4 letters of these 2 different words are interpreted as identical. The suffix "-er" in German is often used as conjugation to transform a word from its gramatical kind.
