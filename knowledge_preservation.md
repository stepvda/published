# Knowledge Preservation Initiative

## Introduction 
Iâ€™m working on a project to preserve knowledge of mankind for future generations.
The idea is to make it less dependant on critical infrastructure such as libraries, internet.
In case critical infrastructure would no longer allow knowledge to be spread than we would provide access for free to what we store.
Distribution could be a format like a DVD or a more limited local network.
We already archive sources such as Wikipedia in many languages. 
I would however prefer not to be dependant on a single source. By this I consider open source content as a single source. Wikipedia as do other media that are open source come with their own particular vulnerabilities. Having access to content about the same or similar topic from multiple sources provides a better guarantee for accuracy and completeness away from bias.

The questions I try to provide a solution to in case of crisis are of a practical kind as well as of a human kind. Here are some examples:    
How can you purify water so you can drink it?  
How to build a wind mill? a solar panel? or even a nuclear power plant?  
What stories can you read your children before they go to sleep?  
Where can you find that book to read for yourself?   
How can you get inspired?  

## View on cultural and political influence
We plan to save knowledge as is. This includes leaving in cultural and political bias. Providing knowledge from multiple sources should make it possible for the reader to choose a particular source that is closer to his or her beleives and convictions. Whomever wishes to understand a broader view can also choose to go through different sources about the same. Different languages will typically also provided more nuanced differences. Translations are therefore also considered important.

## Frequently Asked Questions
This project is in its startup phase. Many aspects of it are still being defined. This includes questions around the topics below. Feel free to contact me directly for any enquiry you have at present. I will provide more information on this page as the project gets underway.  


### What content and what knowledge is identified as worth preserving?
In order not to draw unwanted attention on the internet this list will not be made available here. Please contact us should you want to have a better idea of what we keep.


### How we decide what is useful and what not?


### How we plan on distributing knowledge?


### In which event do we plan to distribute knowledge and what are the exact criteria to determine such an event?


### When would we stop distributing knowledge?


### How are we funded?
This initiative is driven by private individuals that keep the initiative going on their own. Help is always welcome as long as the key principles of what we do and our independence is not jeoperdized. 


### How do we respect intelectual property?
Yes. We respect the rights of the author and share a believe that copyright and other rights to content are key in the proliferation and creation of knowledge itself. Limiting distribution of knowledge to the period or periods where critical infrastructure becomes unavailable should be the first and foremost guarantee to this. We are open to other suggestions and requirements from copyright holders to ensure their rights.
