# Knowledge Preservation Initiative

## Introduction 
Iâ€™m working on a project to preserve knowledge of mankind for future generations.
The idea is to make it less dependant on critical infrastructure such as libraries, internet.
In case critical infrastructure would no longer allow knowledge to be spread than we would provide access for free to what we store.
Distribution could be a format like a DVD or a more limited local network.
We already archive sources such as Wikipedia in many languages. 
I would however prefer not to be dependant on a single source. By this I consider open source content as a single source. Wikipedia as do other media that are open source come with their own particular vulnerabilities. Having access to content about the same or similar topic from multiple sources provides a better guarantee for accuracy and completeness away from bias.

The questions I try to provide a solution to in case of crisis are of a practical kind as well as of a human kind. Here are some examples:    
How can you purify water so you can drink it?  
How to build a wind mill? a solar panel? or even a nuclear power plant?  
What stories can you read your children before they go to sleep?  
Where can you find that book to read for yourself?   
How can you get inspired?  

## View on cultural and political influence
We plan to save knowledge as is. This includes leaving in cultural and political bias. Providing knowledge from multiple sources should make it possible for the reader to choose a particular source that is closer to his or her beleives and convictions. Whomever wishes to understand a broader view can also choose to go through different sources about the same. Different languages will typically also provided more nuanced differences. Translations are therefore also considered important.

## Contact
If you wish to contribute by providing
 - access to content
 - hardware for storage
 - hardware for distribution
 - time to maintain and setup a distribution which obviously includes maintaining a local copy of what we store

## Frequently Asked Questions
This project is in its startup phase. Many aspects of it are still being defined. This includes questions around the topics below. Feel free to contact me directly for any enquiry you have at present. I will provide more information on this page as the project gets underway.  


### What content and what knowledge is identified as worth preserving?
In order not to draw unwanted attention on the internet this list will not be made available here. Please contact us should you want to have a better idea of what we keep.


### How we decide what is useful and what not?
There is no fixed set of rules though I try to prioritize using the following:
 1. Practical to distribute (so no large movies or other media). Limited storage size is a factor. So text with some images is mostly what you get. Being able to easily read, lookup and search without the need to be connected to a network also makes an impact on practicality in a crisis situation.
 2. Knowledge that is directly relevant to a crisis situation. Information about health, survival and so on will be prioritized. Technological kit building instructions belong here as well.
 3. English content will be prioritized over translations. All content is at least available in English (with some exceptions where no translations exist). Next we support all the official languages of the United Nations (English, Arab, French, Russian, Chinese, Spanish). Other languages are provide on a more ad-hoc basis. Broadness of content before translations. 
 4. Non-fiction is prioritized over fiction but we commit strongly to providing a good set of world-literature.
 5. Content itself should be available as non-algoritmic. In the case that content is bundled or built into an application than we would typically look for an alternative in text format such as PDF or HTML. For web content this also means no JavaScript. This is meant to avoid malware.



### How we plan on distributing knowledge?
A copy of a copy of a copy makes 4 copies. Providing sets of content where each set is a reasonable in size so it fits a thumb drive / USB-stick, a DVD or an external hard drive. Just like in a library the information carrier is loaned to the reader. The reader is expected to return it so it can be lent to the next reader. To what extend the reader may in turn copy the information depends on what rights are applicable based on author vs open source and what a given situation can enforce or allow in terms of law. Internaltion and local law may have provisions that take effect in a crisis situation that are of an extraordinary nature disigned to be applicable for a limited time. What is provided to the reader is provided in good faith.
Whenever a local or partial network is available we will try to make inforation available through it. This might as small as an office network, or part of the internet that is still functioning but disconnected from major backbones towards the rest of the world. A basic web server, serving static HTML content and that is running on a spare laptop, can be enough to serve thousands of users. To couter cyberattacks, especially DOS-attacks an approach will be decided for. Especially for a world in crisis we need to factor in that weaponery will also be deployed that is using psychological warfare and therefore requires control over information distribution.


### In which event do we plan to distribute knowledge and what are the exact criteria to determine such an event?
It is our hope that we never have to distribute content. Nonetheless we want to be prepared and we want the world to prepared for the unknown which is the future.
We recognize the world is a complicated place. Nonetheless it is an ever closer connected one. A crisis needs to be considered global or at least regional. One country being at war or hit by a natural disaster is not a valid criteria. This is because we consider that national and internatial relief organizations will still function properly and quickly remediate the situation. 
Not being able to communicate with large parts of the world is the key factor to decide to startup distriction. This might be validated by reaching out to other of our distributions. When these are not reacheable then we prepare. 
 

### When would we stop distributing knowledge?
Immediately after a crisis situation is resolved.


### How are we funded?
This initiative is driven by private individuals that keep the initiative going on their own. Help is always welcome as long as the key principles of what we do and our independence is not jeoperdized. 


### How do we respect intelectual property?
Yes. We respect the rights of the author and share a believe that copyright and other rights to content are key in the proliferation and creation of knowledge itself. Limiting distribution of knowledge to the period or periods where critical infrastructure becomes unavailable should be the first and foremost guarantee to this. We are open to other suggestions and requirements from copyright holders to ensure their rights.
