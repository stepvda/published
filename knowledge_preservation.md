# Knowledge Preservation Initiative

## Introduction 
Iâ€™m working on a project to preserve knowledge of mankind for future generations.
The idea is to make it less dependant of critical infrastructure such libraries, internet.
In case critical infrastructure would no longer allow knowledge to be spread than we would provide free access to what we store.
Distribution could be a format like a DVD or a more limited local network.
We already archive sources such as Wikipedia in many languages. 
I would however prefer not to be dependant on a single source. By this I consider open source content as a single source. However Wikipedia as do other media that are open source come with their own particular vulnerabilities. Having access to content about the same or similar topic from multiple sources provides a better guarantee for accuracy and completeness away from bias.

## View on cultural and political influence
We plan to save knowledge as is. This includes leaving in cultural and political bias. Providing knowledge from multiple sources should make it possible for the reader to choose a particular source that is closer to his or her beleives and convictions. Whomever wishes to understand a broader view can also choose to go through different sources about the same. Different languages will typically also provided more nuanced differences. Translations are therefore also considered important.

## Contact
